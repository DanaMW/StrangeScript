[02:58] <Strange> they both in the same folder?
[02:58] <Strange> try it with the file names
[02:58] <Strange> rpm -Fvh file1.rpm file2.rpm
[02:58] <rdc> they arent in the same folder
[02:59] <Strange> ah they need to be lol
[02:59] <rdc> k
[02:59] <Strange> they have to go in together
[02:59] <rdc> so um... now i need to find where its already installed
[03:02] <Strange> o0
[03:02] <Strange> you installed the one by itself?
[03:02] <rdc> it was already installed
[03:02] <rdc> the rhn updateer
[03:03] <rdc> it did that on my initial install
[03:03] <Strange> be faster to download it then to hunt it up
[03:03] <Strange> inless you used the default sotrage folder of /usr/spool/up2date
[03:03] <rdc> i found the program in usr/bin
[03:05] <Strange> im sorry thats /var/spool/up2date
[03:05] <Strange> nothing to do witht eh program man
[03:06] <Strange> you just need the two rpm's and install them
[03:06] <Strange> just like the docs say
[03:08] <rdc> so i need the earlier version tho
[03:08] <Strange> o0 why?
[03:08] <rdc> it wasnt in /var/spool/up2date
[03:08] <Strange> well thats where IT puts things
[03:08] <rdc> so i need the earlier version tho? is what i meant
[03:09] <Strange> and i put my two rpms there myself

[07:20] <Code> ya
[07:20] <Strange> which ones you setting up
[07:21] <Code> epona
[07:22] <Strange> shoot i havent used them since i started work on coding lakeserv
[07:22] <Strange> they are the ones i came from though
[07:22] <Strange> if i remember right it was a prefab sort of text config
[07:24] <Code> which is the latest version
[07:24] <Strange> meaning that all the options (i think) were defined just need to be changed to reflect your server
[07:24] <Strange> 1.14 i believe

[07:27] <Strange> probibly just temporary
[07:28] <Code> yea
[07:31] <Strange> do you need the eponia on the web?
[07:33] <Code> na all good
[07:33] <Code> still got it
[07:34] <Strange> k
[07:34] <Code> just thinking, if its worth me setting them up
[07:34] <Code> guy who wants me to link, already has them
[07:36] <Strange> well epona has a nice feature where you can run a set in read only mode
[07:36] <Strange> that mode yeilds to the master set
[07:36] <Strange> but still allows the server to have servces names during splits
[07:36] <Strange> so i would think yes
[07:37] <Code> mk ;p
[07:38] <Code> see its with linux as well, not my best os
[07:39] <Code> k its unzipped
[07:39] <Code> do i need to configure by the file
[07:39] <Code> or ./confiure or w/e
[07:40] <Strange> yeah you do both you build it and config by text file .
[07:41] <Strange> i use pico
[07:43] <Code> i need to insert link lines into unrealircd.conf for them as well right

[02:46] <frenchie> before ya set it up...

[02:46] <NightDeath^> fuck fuck cunt shit fmnsa
[02:46] <Strange> you need to turn nat off
[02:46] <Strange> you can not configure it if it is off
[02:47] <Strange> thats what i meant about complicated
[02:47] <Strange> you must FIRST go set a password
[02:47] <Strange> you have to turn the wall on
[02:47] <Strange> then double click the icon in the tool box
[02:47] <Strange> and log into Admin with a blank password
[02:47] <Strange> go to users and ecit admin and enter a password
[02:47] <Strange> then go to

[05:37] <Strange> if you dont have that disk thats a dead end
[05:37] <Strange> it makes a boot floopy for ASR
[05:38] <Strange> you can boot off the floppy
[05:38] <Strange> i mean cd
[05:38] <Strange> and try a repair from there
[05:38] <Strange> if you have the windows cd
[05:38] <frenchie> i don't have an xp cd...came preinstalled
[05:39] <Strange> well to get the data off
[05:40] <Strange> you can restore
[05:40] <Strange> it will be rewound so far that youll have to reformat
[05:40] <Strange> or maybe get lucky with reinstalling all that crap ...
[05:40] <Strange> but at least you get the data back
[05:41] <Strange> man frenchie you sure jiggered yourself
[05:41] <Strange> you were THERE
[05:41] <frenchie> you don't have to tell me that
[05:41] <frenchie> i mean
[05:42] <frenchie> i have a 25pg paper on there due tuesday...and i only have 12pg of it backed up
[05:42] <frenchie> i have an exam monday
[05:42] <Strange> i was gonna add like 5 more ports and go restore it
[05:42] <frenchie> 2 tuesday
[05:42] <Strange> you can put your restore disks in
[05:42] <Strange> it will remnove all the system settings
[05:43] <Strange> but other data will go untouched
[05:43] <Strange> though youll have to find it all manually
[05:43] <frenchie> i think its just a restore to oem disk
[05:43] <Strange> it is likely to remove all email and stuff though
[05:43] <frenchie> email fine
[05:43] <frenchie> screw that
[05:43] <Strange> it should be ok as long as it doesnt format
[05:44] <Strange> if it dont format no extra will be lost
[05:44] <Strange> just the registry
[05:44] <Strange> and all the updates shit like that
[05:44] <Strange> anything windows OS
[05:44] <frenchie> fine...i just need my programming labs and papers
[05:44] <Strange> just dont let it format it
[05:45] <Strange> and your fine
[05:45] <frenchie> the warez stuff i can deal with
[05:45] <Strange> if you could get a windows xp cd
[05:45] <frenchie> but not school stuff
[05:45] <frenchie> not this week
[05:45] <Strange> you could install it on another driver
[05:45] <Strange> -r
[05:45] <Strange> like onto d
[05:45] <Strange> that would even be less likely to damage data
[05:45] <frenchie> hmmm
[05:46] <frenchie> considering i do have c, d, i, j, k partitions on 2 hds
[05:46] <frenchie> that could be an option
[05:46] <Strange> a very good one
[05:46] <frenchie> how much space do i need for an os?
[05:46] <frenchie> heh
[05:46] <Strange> it may repair if you can get a cd too thugh
[05:47] <Strange> there is a repair option during install
[05:47] <Strange> umm not sure
[05:47] <Strange> you can insatll on a 4 gig drive with room left i know that
[05:47] <frenchie> but i can stick a dos boot disk in and delete if i need to
[05:47] <frenchie> right?
[05:47] <Strange> so 2 gigs maybe total
[05:47] <Strange> ?
[05:47] <Strange> i9
[05:47] <Strange> o0
[05:48] <Strange> stick a disk in and delete what?
[05:48] <frenchie> if i didn't have enough space on a partition to install an os
[05:48] <NightDeath^> do you know much about xpeace?
[05:48] <Strange> no
[05:48] <frenchie> but i've got 2gb open
[05:48] <Strange> you have to have the boot disks for XP
[05:48] <frenchie> i've got more than 2gb lol
[05:48] <Strange> its ntfs
[05:48] <frenchie> ok, so an xp boot disk...
[05:48] <Strange> well then that will work
[05:49] <Strange> 4 of them,
[05:49] <Strange> its a 4 disk set
[05:49] <frenchie> i have 4 floppies
[05:49] <Strange> can of course get it off MS or at bootdisk.com
[05:49] <frenchie> right
[05:49] <frenchie> but u recommend getting an xp cd first?
[05:49] <frenchie> and try to do repair?
[05:49] <Strange> well either way
[05:49] <Strange> you need that cd
[05:50] <Strange> but yes i suggest trying to repair it
[05:50] <frenchie> true i suppose
[05:50] <Strange> when you gothrough the install it will come up to repair this partition
[05:50] <Strange> you have to escape back to install on it
[05:50] <Strange> or move ahead to repair
[05:51] <Strange> it comes down to basicly a dos shell
[05:51] <Strange> where you can run restore
[05:51] <Strange> if it doesnt do it auto
[05:51] <Strange> it may go ahead and wrote all the system files
[05:51] <frenchie> and what do i lose if i just plain out install xp again onto that partition?
[05:51] <Strange> which is ok its just a rewind
[05:51] <Strange> nothing thats probibly gonna be what repair does
[05:52] <Strange> as long as you dont format everything is there
[05:52] <Strange> that will get you all yoru files back
[05:52] <Strange> your just gonna have to copy them all off and format c:
[05:53] <frenchie> so i'll have to format c:\
[05:53] <frenchie> but i'll be able to copy it first?
[05:53] <Strange> oh yeah
[05:53] <Strange> see the reason for the format is beacuse all that software has created fgolders
[05:53] <Strange> like nortons will expire
[05:53] <Strange> it will not install over itself
[05:54] <Strange> you are gonna need it to be fresh for it to run right ...
[05:54] <frenchie> right
[05:54] <Strange> at this point ..
[05:54] <frenchie> well, i've got the norton systemworks cd
[05:54] <frenchie> heh
[05:54] <Strange> it wont matter
[05:54] <Strange> it will be expired
[05:54] <Strange> cause it will see it was already installed
[05:55] <frenchie> that i can handle
[05:56] <Strange> its a good move anyway
[05:56] <Strange> it wont be so bad
[05:56] <Strange> once you know your files are safe
[05:56] <Strange> which they are...
[05:57] <frenchie> heh
[05:57] <frenchie> ok, well, staying up until 6am when you have the flu is no good
[05:57] <Strange> if you install on top of it
[05:57] <frenchie> so i'm going to crash
[05:58] <Strange> it will say deleting all windows folders...
[05:58] <frenchie> ok...
[05:58] <Strange> dont freak it just means windows os stuff
[05:58] <Strange> c:\windows and below
[05:58] <frenchie> so installing the os over it would be fine and essentially have the same end result as repair?
[05:58] <Strange> ok frenchie im so sorry that happened to ya
[05:59] <Strange> damn your book al;l to helll
[05:59] <frenchie> heh
[05:59] <frenchie> its not the first time something has gotten pushed against it
[05:59] <frenchie> its just always rebooted again
[05:59] <Strange> ive seen this before many time sfrenchie
[05:59] <Strange> to many times
[06:00] <Strange> fort your records linux ius even less forgiving
[06:00] <frenchie> lol
[06:00] <frenchie> ok
[06:01] <frenchie> i've gotta go back to my room
[06:01] <frenchie> before i get sick

[00:45] <Strange> hell that had an error in it too
[00:45] <Strange> hey frenchie :)
[00:45] <Strange> you got yoru machine back?
[00:45] <frenchie> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[00:45] <frenchie> lol
[00:46] <Strange> man ... was weird not seeing yoru nick
[00:46] <Strange> you back on yours? and how much work do i have to re-do?
[00:46] <frenchie> um
[00:46] <frenchie> i'm not sure any
[00:46] <Strange> you installed over it?
[00:46] <Strange> and did all the updates?
[00:46] <frenchie> i didn't install anything
[00:46] <Strange> o0
[00:47] <frenchie> well
[00:47] <Strange> ok ill bite wtf
[00:47] <Strange> repair worked?
[00:47] <frenchie> i got a pro disk
[00:47] <frenchie> was told i could update
[00:47] <Strange> yes
[00:47] <Strange> true
[00:47] <frenchie> but it wasn't a bootable one
[00:47] <Strange> so thats what ya did?
[00:47] <frenchie> so i got floppies off bootdisk.com
[00:47] <Strange> ohhh well the boot floppies?
[00:47] <frenchie> but
[00:47] <Strange> yeah
[00:48] <frenchie> ti said you can't upgrade from startup disks
[00:48] <Strange> lol
[00:48] <Strange> ouch
[00:48] <frenchie> so i thought i was still screwed
[00:48] <frenchie> but the floppies loaded the recovery console
[00:49] <Strange> yes thats what i was talkign about
[00:49] <frenchie> so i did chkdsk
[00:49] <frenchie> found 1 or more bad sectors
[00:49] <frenchie> so i did it with the recovery switch
[00:49] <frenchie> took 5m to get 52% done
[00:49] <frenchie> then another 10m just to get to 64%
[00:50] <frenchie> but once it was done
[00:50] <Strange> man chewed up that drive ..
[00:50] <frenchie> i exited, rebooted
[00:50] <frenchie> asked me how i wanted to boot
[00:50] <frenchie> i said to start normally
[00:50] <frenchie> and here i am
[00:50] <Strange> your gonna have a bad program somewhere
[00:50] <Strange> soemthign got trashed
[00:50] <Strange> more liely it was remote desktop OR maybe just the temp file it makes
[00:51] <Strange> but when you find one that dont work just reinstall that one
[00:51] <Strange> that will fix it
[00:51] <frenchie> well, should i shut it down manually now?
[00:51] <frenchie> and reboot
[00:51] <Strange> why?
[00:51] <frenchie> or not worry about that?
[00:51] <Strange> to make sure it reboots?
[00:51] <frenchie> dunno, just so its shut down correctly
[00:51] <frenchie> and rebooted correctly
[00:51] <frenchie> guess it doesn't matter
[00:51] <frenchie> heeh
[00:51] <Strange> can but i dont think you have to
[00:51] <Strange> once you chkdisked it your repaird as far as the drive goes
[00:52] <Strange> it will just be some file thats screwed
[00:52] <Strange> look for the check* files
[00:52] <Strange> in root and open them with a hex editor
[00:52] <frenchie> well, after i got out of the recovery console
[00:52] <Strange> maybe (can sometimes) pull ouyt of the garble what file it used to be
[00:52] <frenchie> and xp booted
[00:52] <frenchie> it ran chkdsk itself to check for consistencies
[00:52] <frenchie> and didn't find anything
[00:52] <Strange> good then yoru set
[00:53] <Strange> as far as that goes
[00:53] <frenchie> :)
[00:53] <Strange> can test to be sure.,..
[00:53] <dimmest> you know
[00:53] <frenchie> and winroute pro engine is even running
[00:53] <frenchie> lol
[00:53] <Strange> but if it was still a problem you wouldnt be here
[00:53] <dimmest> i havent been on here in a while
[00:53] <dimmest> and by golly youre still having drive trouble lol
[00:53] <Strange> yes idm
[00:54] <Strange> who is ?
[00:54] <Strange> she is?
[00:54] <dimmest> yea
[00:54] <Strange> wwell its sort of a shitty story
[00:54] <Strange> i spent the last three days
[00:54] <Strange> fixing all her stuff somretimes remotely
[00:54] <Strange> and when i was ALL done
[00:54] <Strange> just finished she hit the off switch with a book
[00:54] <Strange> and screwed up the machien, wouldnt boot
[00:55] <Strange> so then she had to spend all day today recovering it
[00:55] <dimmest> lol that is a shitty story
[00:55] <Strange> which she has , so now she should be all set
[00:55] <Strange> all her networking sisues are gone
[00:55] <dimmest> the system i have in the livingroom has a really loose power cord...i hit it all the time
[00:55] <frenchie> and ya know what
[00:55] <Strange> all her wall issues are gone (except for file transfers)
[00:55] <frenchie> all i needed was to dl boot floppies
[00:56] <Strange> i said that
[00:56] <frenchie> instead of spending all day trying to get an xp disk
[00:56] <frenchie> haha
[00:56] <Strange> o0
[00:56] <Strange> i wouldnt think finding a disk would be hard in collage
[00:56] <Strange> sp*
[00:56] <Strange> i thought that would be easy there
[00:56] <frenchie> well
[00:56] <frenchie> lot of ppl have it preinstalled
[00:56] <Strange> hell i liove in the sticks with dumb mother fuckers and i could go get one in 5 minutes
[00:57] <frenchie> haha!
[00:57] <frenchie> that's cuz you have that all versions cd

[01:03] * Strange changes topic to 'New Script update --> http://www.strangeout.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=getit&lid=9'
[01:03] <Strange> lets do it that way
[01:03] <frenchie> ah
[01:03] <frenchie> excellent!
[01:03] <Strange> what?
[01:04] * frenchie will remember tomorrow to update
[01:04] <frenchie> :)
[01:04] <frenchie> why would i be sending udp to 255.255.255.255?
[01:04] <Strange> why put off till tomorrow what you can screw up today
[01:04] <Strange> thats normal
[01:04] <Strange> thats a broadcast
[01:05] <Strange> forcing an election
[01:05] <Strange> more than likely
[01:05] <Strange> its perfecly normal to brodcast
[01:06] <frenchie> hm, so those shouldn't be dropped packets?
[01:06] <Strange> man was your machien set insecurely
[01:06] <Strange> no they can be dropped
[01:06] <Strange> you dont use netbios anymore
[01:06] <Strange> thansk to me
[01:06] <Strange> thaT SHIT SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN ON ...
[01:06] <Strange> opps
[01:06] <Strange> its fine it does it, you cant stop it , and its fine its dropped
[01:06] <Strange> that shit dont need to get out
[01:07] <Strange> your set fine ...
[01:07] <Strange> except for the ports for the IM file tramnsfers
[01:07] <Strange> and youll find getting dcc transfers not happening
[01:07] <frenchie> yeah
[01:08] <Strange> i only take them from a couple people so what i do is add their ip >1024
[01:08] <Strange> what you can do is stop the wall till the transfer begins
[01:08] <Strange> then you can start the wall again while its going
[01:08] <Strange> the !SYN >1024 rule allows already going transfers to continue
[01:09] <frenchie> ok
[01:09] <frenchie> what type would i add that as...udp, tcp, etc
[01:09] <Strange> for a specific ip?
[01:09] <Strange> dcc is tcp
[01:10] <Strange> be careful who you add
[01:10] <Strange> once added they have full access to the ports you specify
[01:10] <Strange> weithout any filtering
[01:11] <frenchie> right
[01:11] <Strange> and for any transfer its only needed >1024
[01:11] <Strange> above it
[01:11] <Strange> i think... mirc has a way to specify a port range now let me look
[01:12] <Strange> nope
[01:12] <Strange> that would be nice if it was a dcc passive mode huh
[01:12] <Strange> like alot of idea i had for my script... watch next he will add it
[01:13] <Strange> hummm wonder if it can be coded in...
[01:14] <frenchie> lol
[01:15] <Strange> DCC Ports
[01:15] <Strange> This option allows you to specify the range of ports that mIRC will use when making DCC connections. The usual range is 1024 to 5000, though it is possible to specify 64000 as the highest port on some systems.
[01:15] <Strange> see it can
[01:15] <Strange> so then we can just make a rule to allow that port and dcc's will work
[01:16] <frenchie> yeah, mine are at 1024-5000
[01:16] <Strange> set yorus to 1024
[01:16] <frenchie> so i just need to limit those down a few
[01:16] <Strange> put them both to 1024
[01:16] <Strange> mno to one
[01:16] <Strange> just to one port
[01:16] <Strange> dont need more
[01:16] <Strange> then make a rule to allow SYN on 1024
[01:17] <Strange> well you can do a range but then your allowing connects (SYN) to alot of ports
[01:17] <frenchie> how do you specify syn?
[01:17] <Strange> establishing
[01:17] <Strange> umm DCC will only use that port
[01:17] <Strange> so dont check either
[01:17] <Strange> it means the connect (SYN) will be on it and the data too
[01:17] <Strange> which it will
[01:18] <frenchie> destination port = 1024
[01:18] <frenchie> everything else any?
[01:18] <Strange> tcp any host to any host port 1024
[01:19] <frenchie> got it
[01:19] <Strange> do you use anything bedsides MS IM to transfer files?
[01:19] <Strange> cause thats the only one i got in before you killed the machine
[01:20] <frenchie> aim
[01:20] <Strange> go to the connection manager in trillian
[01:20] <frenchie> lemme see if i can find it myself
[01:20] <frenchie> Oo
[01:20] <frenchie> hehe
[01:20] <frenchie> 1 sec
[01:21] <Strange> and edit the properties of your aim account
[01:21] <Strange> and see what port it uses then add it
[01:21] <Strange> oh sorry
[01:21] <Strange> :/ myt bad
[01:21] <frenchie> lol, that part i knew anyway :)
[01:21] <Strange> send me a file dcc would ya ?
[01:21] <Strange> when you get a sec
[01:21] <frenchie> i meant the winroute setting
[01:21] <frenchie> :p
[01:21] <frenchie> k
[01:21] <frenchie> 1 sec
[01:21] <Strange> just any damn old thing
[01:22] <Strange> a song or a text file mabe a nude picture
[01:22] <Strange> i mean picture o0
[01:22] <Strange> see now my hand just typed out the word nude all on its own pretty sad huh
[01:23] <frenchie> u goof
[01:23] <frenchie> :p
[01:23] <Strange> lol
[01:23] <Strange> i didnt do it ....
[01:23] <Strange> im a victim of the circumstances
[01:23] <Strange> thats a 3 stooges joke for anyone old enough to get it
[01:23] <frenchie> w/e u say ;)
[01:24] <frenchie> not i apparently
[01:24] <frenchie> heh
[01:24] <Strange> curly used to say that "im a victim of the circumstances"
[01:24] <Strange> hey though here
[01:25] <Strange> yeah you can check SYN
[01:25] <Strange> cause the other rule allowing !SYN is >1024
[01:25] <frenchie> hmmm, i don't think the msn port got set last night
[01:25] <Strange> so you can check the dcc rule ESTABLISHING only
[01:25] <Strange> it was 18something
[01:25] <Strange> ch3ecking
[01:26] <frenchie> yeah, 1863
[01:26] <frenchie> i don't see any rule for 1863
[01:27] <Strange> humm
[01:27] <Strange> that one must not have saved
[01:27] <Strange> oh yeah
[01:27] <Strange> i did have the editor open
[01:27] <Strange> i didnt press apply
[01:27] <frenchie> hehe
[01:27] <Strange> your right
[01:27] <frenchie> so i want outgoing, source port 1863
[01:28] <Strange> no tcp from any to any port 1863
[01:28] <Strange> might only need be establishing connections (SYN)
[01:28] <Strange> but cant swear to it i dont take files over im
[01:28] <Strange> umm i changed my dcc rule to SYN btw
[01:29] <Strange> cause the other rule allows for !SYN >1024 so its covered once it starts
[01:29] <Strange> wait till you go to secure oputbound lol
[01:29] <Strange> outbound*
[01:30] <frenchie> outgoing any host all ports > any host port=1863 syn
[01:30] <Strange> o0
[01:30] <Strange> yoru also trying to add the outbound rule?
[01:30] <frenchie> wrong?
[01:30] <Strange> its an inbound is all yoru concerned with now
[01:30] <Strange> all inbound
[01:30] <frenchie> kk
[01:31] <Strange> the other one too
[01:33] <Strange> let me restart mirc
[01:33] <frenchie> ok, so that obviously doesn't work...
[01:33] <frenchie> o wait
[01:33] <frenchie> don't i need that to be outbound?
[01:33] <Strange> no
[01:34] <Strange> o0 i just said that your outbound is currently unrestricted
[01:34] <frenchie> silly dcc send
[01:34] <Strange> cept for netbios and pings and the like

[01:35] <Strange> its not the problem isnt 1024
[01:35] <Strange> is
[01:35] <Strange> doh on me
[01:35] <Strange> the SYN port is 59
[01:36] <Strange> the data port is 1024 resend please?
[01:36] <Strange> ok let me see whats blocking here l;ol
[01:36] <Strange> i see the port
[01:36] <Strange> 5 1024 6162448 )
[01:36] <Strange> specified in the dcc send

[01:38] <Strange> umm i guess im blocking nothing
[01:38] <Strange> dont check either in the rule
[01:38] <Strange> and it works fine
[01:38] <frenchie> either = established/establishing?
[01:38] <frenchie> and btw
[01:38] <frenchie> u should listen to that song
[01:38] <Strange> yeah dont check either
[01:38] <frenchie> my fav from this weekend

[01:39] <Strange> so thats dcc and yoru ims
[01:39] <Strange> outbound is a bit trickier
[01:39] <Strange> youll have to log ALL the datas and start with one and go on till you figure out all the programs
[01:39] <Strange> oh yes
[01:40] <Strange> youll need to find out what port your remote desktop uses
[01:40] <Strange> if you dont allow that one no remote
[01:40] <frenchie> very important!
[01:40] <frenchie> haha
[01:40] <Strange> it should be specified in settings i would think... it should be something you can change
[01:41] <Strange> dont forget to test it before work lol or youll have to go without it a whole shift
[01:41] <frenchie> now now
[01:41] <frenchie> do i detect sarcasm

[01:42] <Strange> oh no im just a boyscout type fucker when it comes to planning

[01:58] <frenchie> its like 3d graphing etc
[01:58] <frenchie> we used it in calc class last eyar
[01:58] <frenchie> strange..will you try to ping me plz...someone can't
[01:58] <Strange> ping ont he net?
[01:58] <frenchie> not lag
[01:58] <Strange> all icmp is blocked in and out
[01:59] <frenchie> hehe
[01:59] <frenchie> got it
[01:59] <Strange> you want pings to work?
[01:59] <Strange> in?
[01:59] <Strange> why not just turn back on file sharing and netbios too ....
[01:59] <Strange> for the net ..
[02:00] <frenchie> lol, i don't want it to work
[02:00] <frenchie> its just that he was trying it
[02:00] <frenchie> hehe
[02:00] <frenchie> and i'm still getting used to a firewall that actually blocks stuff
[02:00] <frenchie> LoL
[02:00] <Strange> oh no you dont send out any or get any
[02:00] <Strange> and its off in two places
[02:01] <Strange> its a rule in each in and out plus the wall itself specifies drop icmp
[02:01] <Strange> yahoo failed
[02:01] <Strange> wonder why
[02:01] <frenchie> mine's beend oign that for awhile
[02:02] <Strange> dropping out?
[02:02] <Strange> wonder why that started happening
[02:02] <Strange> ill try restarting it
[02:03] <Strange> nope wont start wonde rif its them or if they detect trillian
[02:03] <Strange> wild to see all the stuff your actually blocking now huh
[02:04] <Strange> this is a tough wall i have taken packets form 150 bots without negative effects with it
[02:05] <Strange> of course here they would have to stuff two modems to matter much :)
[02:06] <frenchie> lol
[02:10] <frenchie> hey, what is the different/advantages of passive mode on ftp?
[02:10] <Strange> you must use passive if your bnehind a wall
[02:10] <Strange> otherwise youd have to allow all the ports
[02:11] <Strange> and sivnce thats retarded we use passive
[02:11] <frenchie> k, have to set that up in raiden
[02:11] <Strange> passive tells the other machien that data connections only can happen on the specified port(s)
[02:11] <Strange> so you can then make rules to allow it
[02:11] <Strange> sort of like what we did with mirc just now
[02:12] <frenchie> hm, i don't see passive, but i see 'use data port range'
[02:14] <Strange> is that something running on your machine?
[02:15] <Strange> this raiden ftp. is it a new server instead of the one you were running?
[02:15] <frenchie> yeah
[02:15] <frenchie> well
[02:15] <frenchie> servu limits speed
[02:16] <frenchie> and i just haven't gotten around to switching everything over to raiden
[02:16] <frenchie> figrue now is a good time
[02:16] <Strange> it has to specify passive somewhere
[02:16] <Strange> cause it will have to know what ip to apply the port limits to
[02:17] <NightDeath^> you 2 could talk under water
[02:17] <NightDeath^> lol
[02:17] <NightDeath^> way to kill the convo TIMMY

[22:24] <Strange> Norton Password Manager protects your Windows program and Internet logon information, and stores address and credit card information for e-commerce transactions. Norton Password Manager automatically recognizes programs and Web sites that require you to log on, and, with your consent, provides the logon information automatically. The information you store in Norton Password Manager is encrypted.
[22:24] <Strange> Norton Password Manager also helps you to create passwords that are hard to guess. This increased security makes your computing activity more secure.

[02:46] <Strange> run the bat file
[02:46] <Strange> oh yeah
[02:46] <Strange> you diont have the bat file lol
[02:47] <Strange> in the unreal folder
[02:47] <Strange> is a bat file called
[02:47] <Strange> makecert.bat
[02:47] <Strange> you have toi run it to create a self signed cert for unreal
[02:47] <Strange> just use yoru servr info
[02:47] <Strange> it asks each question
[02:47] <Strange> if you dont haver that bat file?
[02:48] <Strange> thsi is the contents
[02:48] <Strange> @title Certificate Generation
[02:48] <Strange> openssl req -new -config ssl.cnf -out server.req.pem -keyout server.key.pem -nodes
[02:48] <Strange> openssl req -x509 -config ssl.cnf -days 365 -in server.req.pem -key server.key.pem -out server.cert.pem
[02:48] <optik> i dont have the bat file either lol
[02:48] <Strange> thats the contents
[02:49] <Strange> create a file called 'makecert.bat'
[02:49] <Strange> edit it and paste them three lines in it then run it
[02:49] <Strange> it will ask you for your town your name your servr ip shit like that
[02:50] <Strange> then it will create the certs for you
[02:50] <Strange> then your unreal will be able to take full advantage of ssl connetions
[02:51] <Code> ya thats neat, how'd u get & etc...
[02:51] <Strange> the openssl.exe should be in the unreal folder fromt he zip you got from strangeout
[02:51] <Code> did you edit the coding
[02:51] <Strange> yeah i edited the code
[02:51] <Strange> its basicly in it
[02:51] <Code> if someone else links, does it change for them?
[02:51] <Strange> you have to enable it and i customised it to be . instead of ~
[02:52] <Strange> they see wat there server allows
[02:52] <Strange> but i send out the exe to them if they want to link
[02:52] <Strange> so that we both have the same version
[02:52] <Strange> =-=-=-= Unreal3.2-beta18-StrangeOut1.3 =-=-=-=
[02:52] <Code> ya
[02:52] <optik> openssl.exe?
[02:52] <Strange> thats was in the zip idm
[02:52] <optik> ok i ran the bat and it just ran and closed
[02:53] <Strange> should extract all those files to the unreal folder
[02:53] <optik> i did
[02:53] <optik> should i run openssl.exe then?
[02:53] <Code> bloody shell
[02:53] <Strange> you ran the bat file from the unreal folder?
[02:53] <optik> yep
[02:53] <Strange> no its calls it
[02:53] <Strange> let me try putting the bat file in the zip once agfain
[02:53] <Code> now msn has closed, everyones hitting ircd
[02:53] <Strange> maybe an error in editing
[02:54] <Strange> oHHH
[02:54] <Strange> I KNOW WHY IDM
[02:54] <Strange> there is one file you didnt get

[02:55] <Strange> ok ready for you to reget it
[02:55] <Strange> the ssl.cnf
[02:55] <Strange> i forgot to put it in the zip that and two bat files are added to the zip

[02:56] <Strange> now it will run ... it was looking for the *.cnf file in the make bat
[02:57] <Strange> ----> openssl req -new -config ssl.cnf
[02:57] <Strange> damn i got everything in the zip now cept my configs
[02:57] <Strange> should have just zipped up the whole folder :)

[02:59] <Strange> ok now your gonna run
[02:59] <Code> strange, would that version u edited work on linux
[02:59] <Strange> i can feel it
[02:59] <Strange> yes iut does
[03:00] <Strange> i run it on redhat
[03:00] <Strange> well not the exe ...
[03:00] <Strange> i just transfered the edited code to linux then recompiled
[03:00] <Code> oh ok
[03:00] <Strange> its the same source code
[03:00] <optik> woohoo
[03:00] <optik> it stayed open
[03:00] <optik> lol
[03:00] <Strange> good deal man
[03:00] <Strange> umm you need to add this?
[03:00] <Strange> :
[03:01] <Strange> to your unreal config?
[03:01] <Strange> 	ssl {
[03:01] <Strange> 		egd;
[03:01] <Strange> 		certificate "server.cert.pem";
[03:01] <Strange> 		key "server.key.pem";
[03:01] <Strange> 	};
[03:01] <Strange> directly above DNS at the near bottom of the config
[03:01] <Strange> hers a snapshot of mine
[03:01] <Strange> 	ssl {
[03:01] <Strange> 		egd;
[03:01] <Strange> 		certificate "server.cert.pem";
[03:01] <Strange> 		key "server.key.pem";
[03:01] <Strange> 	};
[03:01] <Strange> 	dns {
[03:01] <Strange> 		nameserver	127.0.0.1;
[03:01] <Strange> 		timeout	3s;
[03:01] <Strange> 		retries 	2;
[03:01] <Strange> 	};
[03:01] <Strange> 	options {
[03:01] <Strange> 		identd-check;
[03:02] <optik> that isnt in there unless something put it there
[03:02] <optik> add it?
[03:02] <Strange> add it yes
[03:02] <Strange> its requirted for ssl to connect
[03:02] <Strange> i have ssl ports here , 8000
[03:03] <Strange> heres how you enable ssl on a port
[03:03] <Strange> listen		*:8000
[03:03] <Strange> {
[03:03] <Strange> 	options
[03:03] <Strange> 	{
[03:03] <Strange> 		clientsonly;
[03:03] <Strange> 		ssl;
[03:03] <Strange> 	};
[03:03] <Strange> };
[03:03] <Strange> that makes my port 8000 ssl only
[03:03] <Strange> but you need that ssl { directive that i pasted above for it to funtion
[03:04] <Strange> you can make a port sll and normal
[03:04] <Strange> its one or the other
[03:04] <Strange> cant*
[03:04] <Strange> and umm ssl*
[03:04] <Strange> trying again
[03:04] <Strange> you cant make a port ssl and normal
[03:04] <Strange> its one or the other
[03:05] <Strange> ssl is handy for chatting to people when you dont want the outside world to read it
[03:05] <NightDeath^> yous seem to be having fun
[03:05] <Strange> if you want to talk with someone securly both log in ssl
[03:05] <Strange> then only ther server itself sees it the transmitted data is encrypted
[03:05] <Strange> on my web
[03:06] <Strange> is a SSL utility for mirc and windows
[03:06] <Strange> that allws you to connect SSL with mirc
[03:06] <Strange> if you use my script
[03:06] <Strange> its built in
[03:06] <Strange> Format: /ssl <network> <server> <port>
[03:06] <optik> it says only servers can set that mode....thats right right?
[03:07] <Strange> sop to connect here would be /ssl strangeout strangeout.com 8000
[03:07] <Strange> yes
[03:07] <Strange> what mode?
[03:07] <Strange> im not sure what mode.... but the server dont lie
[03:07] <Strange> like +r
[03:07] <Strange> or +x
[03:08] <Strange> they are server controled
[03:08] <Strange> here i dont even let non-opers do stats
[03:08] <Strange> maxchannelsperuser		10;
[03:08] <Strange> 	anti-spam-quit-message-time	30s;
[03:08] <Strange> 	/* static-quit "Client quit";	*/
[03:08] <Strange> 	oper-only-stats			*;
[03:08] <optik> like
[03:08] <Strange> thats controled by the last line there
[03:08] <optik> if you did //mode # +q optik
[03:09] <Strange> oh yes +q is operserv
[03:09] <Strange> use operserv you must be ulined to set that mode
[03:09] <Strange> //operserv mode # +q nick
[03:09] <optik> oooo k
[03:09] <optik> i did samode
[03:09] <optik> lol
[03:09] <Strange> got to be ulined to use it
[03:09] <Strange> cycle it will set you
[03:09] <Strange> lakeserv will
[03:09] <NightDeath^> บ( SMP 5.6 )บ( Spool 1 of 1 )บ( mp3 )บ( Chingy-Right_Thurr )บ
[03:09] <Strange> if your the founder it will +q you
[03:09] <Strange> you must DC fromt he server
[03:10] <Strange> oh you did
[03:10] <Strange> cause the new info is sent on connect in the RAW 005 info
[03:10] <Strange> to mirc i mean
[03:10] <Strange> telling mirc about the modes available
[03:10] <NightDeath^> ulined?

[03:41] <Strange> fire away im ready
[03:41] <NightDeath^> i guess your bot dont like iraq
[03:41] <Strange> thats a z not an s
[03:41] <optik> well my cheesy mp3 player
[03:41] <optik> i did the room notices
[03:41] <optik> using /amsg
[03:41] <NightDeath^> says s on the map
[03:41] <Strange> /scid -a <valid mirc command>
[03:41] <optik> so how do i do it so it works on multi-server?
[03:42] <Strange> -a is all servers
[03:42] <Strange> thsi is mine
[03:42] <Strange> scid -a amsg $report(%MEDIA.ve
[03:42] <Strange> mirc help explains the other options for /scid
[03:42] <Strange> you can specify which session too
[03:43] <Strange> i use scid alot in my script
[03:43] <Strange> the only shortcoming i had to overcome for multiserver was timers
[03:43] <Strange> you have to start EACH timer in EACH session
[03:44] <Strange> so i appended the network name to the timer
[03:44] <Strange> * Active timers:
[03:44] <Strange> * Timer alive.strangeout 45s delay /sw all god-find (StrangeOut)
[03:44] <Strange> * Timer bar.strangeout 500ms delay mybar (StrangeOut)
[03:44] <Strange> * Timer 850.strangeout 15s delay Lagchk (StrangeOut)
[03:44] <Strange> * Timer nick.strangeout 15s delay assimilate Strange (StrangeOut)
[03:44] <Strange> so it would start in every session
[03:44] <Strange> and not just in the active
[03:45] <Strange> .timerBAR. $+ $network -om 0 500 mybar
[03:45] <Strange> keywrite settings ircx OFF
[03:45] <Strange> .timerIRCX. $+ $network 1 1 ircx
[03:46] * Code (~code@CPE-203-45-244-162.qld.bigpond.net.au) Quit
[03:46] <Strange> and man do i have alot of timers in this pig
[03:46] <optik> ty man lol

[03:46] <Strange> sure dude
[03:46] <Strange> wb codeiphile
[03:46] <Code> hehe ta
[03:46] <Code> 8 servers eh
[03:46] <Strange> was that a strangeout issue or you just reuppin?
[03:46] <Code> do you run them all ?
[03:46] <Strange> yeah
[03:46] <Code> me
[03:46] <Strange> yes
[03:47] <Code> ya i meant, it was a me issue
[03:47] <Code> :P
[03:47] <Strange> i run them all there is two people that link but one is offline the other i got tired of seeing it join and part all day cause of being dialup ...
[03:47] <Code> i need to put a timer of some sort to refresh me, so i dont time out
[03:47] <Code> like an away sys or something
[03:47] <Strange> and no one even using it so i just blocked dans server for now till he gets dsl
[03:48] <Code> often i wake up, and as soon as i say something, i d/c
[03:48] <Strange> i use the alive
[03:48] <Code> who knows why
[03:48] <Strange> lag check would do it
[03:48] <Code> ya
[03:48] <Strange> i send the command God-Find
[03:48] <Strange> to stay alive
[03:48] <Code> hmm ya
[03:48] <Code> ok
[03:48] <Strange> and my sockets too
[03:49] <Strange> thats weas that .alove timer above
[03:49] <Code> u can send anything cant you
[03:49] <Strange> yeah
[03:49] <Strange> just filter the rteturn
[03:49] <Strange> so that if its say "God-Find"
[03:49] <Strange> you dont keep seeing the not a command thing
[03:49] <Code> ya lol
[03:50] <Strange> i use a lag checker too at 15 sec intervals thats keeps me alive on most servers
[03:50] <Strange> <- :strangeout.com 421 Strange GOD-FIND :Unknown command
[03:50] <Code> the pong reply should do it though ;\
[03:50] <Strange> raw 421
[03:50] <Strange> should
[03:50] <Code> doesnt lol
[03:50] <Strange> but it never worked alone for me
[03:51] <Strange> so i added the god-find for the sockets and a 15 second lag check for me
[03:51] * wolflord is now known as wolflord-away

[03:52] <Strange> just filter raw 421
[03:52] <Strange> if (*god-find* iswm $1-) { halt }
[03:52] <Code> mk
[03:52] <Strange> if you use god-find that is lol
[03:52] <Code> make a lil loop so it does all of them
[03:53] <Strange> can always send strange-sucks or somehting
[03:53] <Code> hehe
[03:53] <Strange> i wrote a SW (Sock Write) routine for the sockets
[03:53] <Strange> that takes a param of all ... or an individual socket name
[03:53] <Strange> i can do /sw all raw command to send it to all of them
[03:54] <Strange> Ohh you mean to weach server?
[03:54] <Strange> 1
[03:54] <Strange> //say $scid(0)
[03:54] <Strange> thats how many servers yoru hooked to
[03:55] <Strange> so you can loop using that as the check
[03:55] <Strange> or while loop
[03:55] <Strange> then you can send it to each one using /scid incrementally up
[03:55] <Strange> just a thought sorry
[03:56] <Code> lol yep
[03:56] <Strange> man sometimes having a geek hang out is just cool :)
[03:56] <Strange> fuck all them evil normal people o0
[03:56] <Code> ya
[03:56] * Strange looks around wildly

[04:08] <Code> ya
[04:08] <Code> i was irc.msn as well
[04:08] <Strange> you should have tried to steal a pay users info lol
[04:08] <Code> then right up untill it closed
[04:08] <Code> ya..
[04:08] <Code> lol
[04:08] <Strange> so you could sub-layer it with that onfo lol
[04:08] <Strange> you know that first server log on thing
[04:09] <Code> erm?
[04:09] <Code> first server
[04:09] <Code> as in finds server..
[04:09] <Strange> well from what i rememeber when i added it to my script you log on local
[04:09] <Strange> then sockets go out and send the info to and from the correct server?
[04:09] <Strange> like one for nick...
[04:09] <Code> ya
[04:10] <Strange> then the one you connect to?
[04:10] <Strange> i added with m0
[04:10] <Strange> but never used it but a few times
[04:10] <Code> ya connect to the finds server
[04:10] <Code> and get the channel ip
[04:10] <Strange> ahh ok
[04:10] <Strange> and you could steal nick on there too
[04:10] <Strange> nicks*
[04:10] <Code> ya ;)
[04:10] <Strange> so i assume we could steal identity of a pay user
[04:11] <Code> ya, theres ways
[04:11] <Code> i could find out, but im not sure if i wanna go back
[04:11] <Strange> im glad they closed

[04:12] <Strange> Oh wait
[04:12] <Strange> yoru not exchange server anymore
[04:13] <Strange> i have a copy of the sysop comnmands from peoples
[04:13] <Strange> i have seen a one number higher newer version but these work fine
[04:13] <Code> how did u scroll through your servers connected...
[04:13] <Code> in your loop
[04:14] <Strange> var %tmp = 1
[04:14] <Code> lol
[04:14] <Code> i mean like $scid
[04:14] <Strange> while (%tmp <= $scid(0)) {
[04:14] <Code> ya
[04:14] <Code> little lower
[04:14] <Code> one line lower
[04:14] <Strange> i find i havce to use less than or equal
[04:15] <Strange> ok then i send the command
[04:15] <Code> but, how to each server
[04:15] <Code> scon..
[04:15] <Strange> The /scon command works in exactly the same way, except that N represents the Nth connection, not a connection id value
[04:15] <Strange> yeah 1 2 3 4 5
[04:16] <Strange> other wise you need $cid
[04:16] <Strange> in the ()
[04:16] <Code> ah ill use cid
[04:16] <Strange> i use cid i dont use scon
[04:17] <Strange> -t# is valuable for catching not connected errors
[04:20] <Strange> my title bar changes depending on the active server
[04:20] <Strange> that shit took me two hours to write

[04:26] <Code> i dont get a unknown command though
[04:26] <Strange> and its saved my ass a few times
[04:26] <Strange> you send the command al;ive
[04:26] <Strange> ?
[04:26] <Code> ya
[04:27] <Strange> you can check the debug by typing '/debug @debug'
[04:27] <Strange> and watching what goes to the @debug window
[04:27] <Code> m
[04:28] <Strange> when your done with it just type /debug off and close the window or just close it
[04:28] <Strange> umm that will tell you if in fact raw 421 is coming back And if yoru acually sending it right

[04:31] <Code> thats soo weird
[04:31] <Strange> if i remember right there was soime weird thing about /scid
[04:31] <Code> it sends like 50 raws the cid 1, and none else
[04:31] <Strange> lol funny you said that
[04:31] <Strange> Oh cause you can only get the cid from the session that calls the command
[04:31] <Strange> you still pit a number in there
[04:32] <Strange> put..
[04:32] <Strange> even though it says put the cid all the while loop does is make sure %tmp doesnt go above $scid(0)
[04:32] <Strange> use %tmp
[04:32] <Strange> where you have $cid now
[04:33] <Strange> it wont know that %tmp is a incrementing number as long as it matches all the $cid's which it will
[04:33] <Strange> 2
[04:33] <Strange> 1
[04:34] <Strange> 1
[04:34] <Strange> Oh,,,,
[04:34] <Strange> hey man cid is the damn window session number
[04:34] <Code> ya
[04:34] <Strange> thats what it was
[04:35] <Strange> so your gonna have to use scon
[04:36] <Strange> to make it match %tmp
[04:36] <Strange> simple change in that one line and bam you should be working
[04:37] <Code> nup still did it
[04:37] <Strange> well then you can use temp like .scon %tmp raw alive
[04:37] <Code> with scon
[04:37] <Strange> are you including the -r ?
[04:37] <Code> nope
[04:38] <Strange> try using -r so it resets

[04:39] <Code> its saved a lot of mirc crashs
[04:39] <Strange> umm i take it that didnt work/
[04:39] <Strange> what i do
[04:39] <Strange> is when i start mirc
[04:39] <Strange> i do the timer with the network name in it
[04:39] <Strange> then its right from the start
[04:39] <Strange> its more timers

[04:45] <Strange> //say $scid(1)
[04:45] <Strange> 11
[04:45] <Strange> ah its null
[04:45] <Strange> why would mine go from 1 to 11
[04:45] <Strange> thats sooo stupid
[04:45] <Strange> here is $cid 1 and dalnet is $cid 11
[04:46] <Code> whats your timer
[04:46] <Code> every 5 secs?
[04:46] <Strange> the time i use?
[04:46] <Strange> for lag is 15 seconds
[04:46] <Strange> any more and youll lag off line lol
[04:47] <Strange> i send it $calc(ping/pong / 2) for the sockets
[04:47] <Strange> so 45 seconds here
[04:47] <Code> ok lets try this

[04:48] <Code> * Timer strangeout.com 15s delay raw :ello (StrangeOut)
[04:48] <Strange> now if you are on more than one server checkign the /timer should show it on both?
[04:48] <Strange> yeah thats it exactly
[04:48] <Strange> thats how i got by that silly cid thing
[04:48] <Code> and on my d/c it turns it off
[04:48] <Code> so it shouldnt stuff
[04:48] <Strange> ah.. yeah they will auto unless you specify offline timer
[04:49] <Code> the problem with cid, if u close a server. the rest dont update
[04:49] <Strange> they default to online timers
[04:49] <Code> so u could be missing "1"
[04:49] <Strange> ohhh well $scon(1) covers that
[04:49] <Strange> 1
[04:49] <Strange> //say $scon(1)
[04:49] <Strange> //say $scon(2)
[04:49] <Strange> 11
[04:50] <Strange> thats how you find out the cid for connections using 1 2 3 4 5
[04:50] <Code> oh
[04:50] <Strange> so you can put $scon(%tmp) where you want the cid to be
[04:50] <Code> well why was it sending 100's to one cid
[04:50] <Code> and not the rest

[04:51] <Strange> maybe cause scid doesnt account for a null return ...
[04:51] <Strange> which you get with 2-10 here as an example
[04:52] <Strange> if ($scid(%tmp) != $null) { command }
[04:52] <Code> oh ok
[04:52] <Code> oh well, ill stick with timers
[04:52] <Strange> lol me too lol
[04:52] <Strange> ALOT easier and no lockups :)
[04:52] <Code> ya
[04:52] <Strange> I noticed i had to use the alive timer to detect splits or drops on the old msn
[04:53] <Code> hmm
[04:53] <Strange> like to detect quicker that i wasnt connected any more
[04:53] <Code> i used on sockclose
[04:53] <Strange> on msn i used to run them at 10 seconds
[04:53] <Strange> oh you always kept a socket online?
[04:53] <Code> ya
[04:54] <Strange> if i turned the timer off it could take mirc 30 seconds to know it was dc'd
[04:54] <Code> ew
[04:54] <Strange> with it on it seemed to me to detect it right away
[04:55] <Strange> thats only a theaory
[04:55] <Strange> i cant prove that lol
[04:56] <Code> ya i had other timers i think
[04:56] <Code> i think i had an access timer running all the time
[04:56] <Strange> oh yeah the good old access list
[04:56] <Strange> lol i have a win2k server still running here
[04:56] <Strange> i just wouldnt even THINK of putting it in the front ....
[04:57] <Code> lol
[04:57] <Code> anyway to hide "-> Server: :ello"
[04:57] <Strange> yes
[04:57] <Strange> its done like this
[04:57] <Strange> you mean the raw 421?
[04:58] <Code> no no, done that
[04:58] <Code> just the send raw, it echos what ur sending

[05:02] <Code> i love the raw command
[05:02] <Code> espectially within services

[05:03] <Strange> yeah its up
[05:03] <Strange> ummm
[05:03] <Strange> the ONLY thing i cant overcome with mirc
[05:03] <Strange> is itys stripping of multiple spaces
[05:04] <Strange> if there are more than 1 space it strips it down to one
[05:04] <Strange> and i cant for the life of me get it to cut that shit out
[05:04] <Strange> thats what screws up alot of song plays in my mp3 player
[05:06] <Code> i made my mp3 when i first hit msn, used the same version ever since, only editied it once, to add .wmp files in
[05:06] <Strange> i update mine pretty often
[05:06] <Code> most simple mp3 as well, yet i used it so much
[05:06] <Strange> i play the files myself
[05:07] <Strange> dont pass them to any programs unless its not a standard file type
[05:07] <Strange> mine is a dialog with volume and all
[05:07] <Strange> it even integrates with the title bar

[05:19] <Strange> m0 says i need to give in and buy a router
[05:20] <Code> because my isp wont let me connect 2 at once through the same modem, which i could before, but they wanted to kill me for it
[05:20] <Code> ya
[05:20] <Code> or a hub
[05:20] <Strange> no way?
[05:20] <Strange> how can they stop you if you use nat
[05:20] <Strange> they dont even know
[05:20] <Code> well i use xp one now
[05:20] <Strange> you can make the home network undectable
[05:20] <Code> which works ok
[05:20] <Code> they cant detect me now
[05:20] <Strange> yeah ok
[05:21] <Code> and i got it running through a hub, so i can have a few people connected
[05:21] <Strange> i got 5 running through one on ICS and one standalone on the other modem
[05:21] <Code> good for online gaming
[05:21] <Strange> but im supposed to be 3.0 / 512

[05:22] <Strange> 7.0 kbps down and up lol
[05:23] <Strange> i gave up and shut the other modem off till monday when they get here

[05:24] <Strange> like when you put the modem on but its not authorized
[05:24] <Code> oh, why 2 modems..
[05:24] <Strange> so that i can service clients without laging the other connections
[05:24] <Code> oh
[05:24] <Strange> i do alot of remote work and manage half a dozen domains
[05:25] <Strange> including virtual hosting of webs?
[05:25] <Code> oh
[05:25] <Strange> so i needed to split it up so that we dont lag here
[05:25] <Code> and they are all running of roughtly 7 kb?
[05:25] <Strange> plus i run my own dns server
[05:25] <Strange> only that one modem was
[05:25] <Strange> this one was basicly normal
[05:25] <Code> oh ok
[05:26] <Strange> one works fine the other wont authorize
[05:26] <Strange> can reverse it ... both work
[05:26] <Code> ya i was running everything at one point
[05:26] <Strange> i got a neat program from m0
[05:26] <Strange> it will allow you to change yoru mack address
[05:27] <Strange> which you need to change yoru ip if your under attack
[05:27] <Strange> otherwise youd have to boot down and change cards to get another ip
[05:27] <Code> so you can change ur ip?
[05:27] <Strange> you can too
[05:27] <Strange> ybut yes
[05:27] <Code> how...

[05:28] <Code> oh ok
[05:28] <Strange> if you change yoru netcards mac you get a new ip
[05:29] <Code> so you would need to buy a new card
[05:29] <Strange> so with this little spoofer you can change the mac address disable the card and reenable the card and bam its got a new mack address
[05:29] <Code> or get a differnt one
[05:29] <Strange> yes i keep three here
[05:30] <Code> and with ur lil prog. u dont need to

[06:48] <m0> I've never used it
[06:48] <m0> I'm a big fan of loops.  :)
[06:48] <Strange> a while loop drops the bot
[06:48] <m0> You can use timers
[06:48] <Strange> on that big on there
[06:48] <Strange> pause it you mean?
[06:48] <m0> I always use timers to slow the while loops down
[06:48] <Strange> at the return?
[06:48] <m0> Nah
[06:49] <Strange> mind showing me how you slow up a while loop ? lol

[16:53] <ChiefsAre9-0> i'm trying to get the parser to recognize my timestamp
[16:53] <ChiefsAre9-0> its being fussy
[16:54] <Strange> just dupe what you have it set to in the script
[16:54] <Strange> my script cant log for mircstats
[16:54] <Strange> cause of the custom text
[16:55] <Strange> nothing in mine include like /me is not custom
[16:55] <Strange> all that is modified
[16:55] <Strange> i fixed keyboard paste for you
[16:55] <Strange> btw
[16:55] <Strange> you can paste using control v now without hexing if its more than one line
[16:56] <ChiefsAre9-0> cool
[16:56] <Strange> one line in the buffer and its hexed any more than one it assumes its a paste
[16:56] <Strange> humm i sort of want to redo the color but thats about 2500 entries
[16:58] <Strange> .raw msg strange yo'
[16:58] <ChiefsAre9-0> entered line was not recognized with current parser configuration
[16:58] * ChiefsAre9-0 throws vases
[16:59] <Strange> damn echo makes the line beep ...
[16:59] <Strange> if its got -l in it ...
[16:59] <Strange> that should be an auto iff()
[16:59] <Strange> silly mirc
[17:01] <ChiefsAre9-0> cool...i got it
[17:01] <ChiefsAre9-0> ;)
[17:01] <ChiefsAre9-0> i was including color codes in the parser config
[17:01] <ChiefsAre9-0> but the log didn't have those
[17:01] * ChiefsAre9-0 smacks herself
[17:02] <Strange> .raw msg strange yo'
[17:02] <Strange> humm
[17:03] <Strange> .raw msg strange yo'

[17:06] <ChiefsAre9-0> mIRCStats for #hmg updated! Check the stats at [Edit Config/Channel_info.txt to insert your URL here]
[17:06] <ChiefsAre9-0> LoL
[17:07] <Strange> thats what my stats are made with.. mirc stats but its a copy i unupxed
[17:07] <Strange> un-upx'd
[17:07] <Strange> amnd its an older one
[17:08] <Strange> probibly should update it someday but it works and i dont really care about stats
[17:09] <ChiefsAre9-0> just having fun with it
[17:10] <Strange> trying to decide what to do with these colors id like to ditch any settings i have that are part of mirc now ...
[17:11] <Strange> many of the things i coded in he includes now
[17:14] <Strange> /test
[17:14] <ChiefsAre9-0> now i just need to find a key, so i can have the pretty detailed section

[17:23] <ChiefsAre9-0> lol
[17:23] <Strange> hes been called that for years
[17:24] <Strange> i dont like calling them eggs
[17:24] <Strange> doesnt seem to fit to me
[17:24] <ChiefsAre9-0> one of these days i need to get my butt in to gear and organize the snippets of bot code i have into 1 bot
[17:24] <ChiefsAre9-0> but i don't have
[17:24] <ChiefsAre9-0> nor experience
[17:24] <ChiefsAre9-0> hehe
[17:25] <Strange> i dont know what made me start coding mirc today .. oh yeah tim found a small error
[17:25] <Strange> then i found out i could update way to much stuff
[17:26] <ChiefsAre9-0> lol
[17:27] <ChiefsAre9-0> i'd like to eventually write a full bot somewhat like mrx...there's just no time for a college student to do such
[17:29] <Strange> hes so full he might as well be a whole script
[17:29] <Strange> matter of fact thats what my script is based from
[17:29] <Strange> i took the bot and started a script with him
[17:30] <ChiefsAre9-0> awesome
[17:30] <Strange> him i started 5 or 6 years ago
[17:30] <Strange> oh man

[17:39] <ChiefsAre9-0> just make sure ya take the laptop with ya
[17:39] <ChiefsAre9-0> :p
[17:39] <Code> donno why the net does that
[17:39] <Code> just cuts out
[17:41] <Strange> yeah i checked here
[17:42] <Strange> if you look in the syslog see if dhcp is resetting
[17:42] <Strange> on some customers they neglect to allow the localnet ip of the isp's dhcp server so it drops them then reassignes
[17:43] <Strange> causes that very event
[17:43] <Strange> like here i have to allow the 68.* ip for dhcp and i also have to allow the 10.* ip too
[17:43] <Strange> if i dont do both it keeps failing to assign then after it drops the ip it gets it back ...
[17:44] <Strange> the 10.* ip seems to allow it to maintain it
[17:44] <Strange> just a though
[17:44] <Strange> your drops are on a schedual
[17:44] <ChiefsAre9-0> strange...you have any good web resources off the top of your head where i can read about the servers that linux allows...like dns mainly
[17:44] <Strange> o0
[17:45] <Strange> umm let me figure this question out
[17:45] <ChiefsAre9-0> lol
[17:45] <Strange> linux allows damn near everything
[17:45] <ChiefsAre9-0> so in red hat 9, under servers, there's domain name service
[17:45] <Strange> dns in 99% of the world is done with BIND
[17:45] <ChiefsAre9-0> and i wanna find a resource about
[17:45] <ChiefsAre9-0> um, yes
[17:45] <Strange> oh good luck
[17:45] <ChiefsAre9-0> metnions bind
[17:45] <Strange> I do NOT support bind
[17:45] <Strange> it was a mother
[17:45] <ChiefsAre9-0> figure i should read before i screw up
[17:45] <Strange> the worst thing
[17:46] <Strange> to get running and right
[17:46] <ChiefsAre9-0> well, i know nothing about dns
[17:46] <ChiefsAre9-0> really
[17:46] <Strange> yes it was hard
[17:46] <Strange> the help for it is scattered and stupidly written
[17:46] <ChiefsAre9-0> there's different ways of doing it?
[17:46] <Strange> no two helps were alike so there was no reference points
[17:46] <Strange> lol more than two :)
[17:47] <Strange> it was hard took me two weeks to begin testing
[17:47] <Strange> and another month to trust my work
[17:47] <Strange> alot of things to concider when you run a dns server
[17:48] <Strange> i simply couldnt possibly explain dns in a way that would make it easy for someone
[17:48] <Strange> they have a windows one
[17:48] <Strange> SompleDNS
[17:48] <Strange> opps
[17:48] <Strange> SimpleDNS
[17:49] <Strange> i used that up till i made the move to bind
[17:49] <ChiefsAre9-0> hmmm
[17:49] <ChiefsAre9-0> i'll have to investigate
[17:49] <Strange> he changed the method for $input() in mirc...
[17:50] <Strange> theres another 1000 changes

[02:50] <Strange> you ever see the flood control in this script idm?
[02:50] <Strange> i can honestly say its one of the best in the business lol
[02:50] <Strange> i got the idea to do them all from one routine
[02:51] <optik> i thought youd be easy
[02:51] <optik> coz i used to flood alot of tards on silly scripts
[02:52] <optik> i still remember that time
[02:52] <optik> i was flooding with all i had and ur ass didnt even flinch
[02:52] <optik> LOL
[02:52] <Strange> you thought id flood easy?
[02:52] <optik> yea coz it did so much stuff
[02:52] <Strange> oh yeah thats one thisn this script dont do flood
[02:52] <optik> generally the more they do the easier they flood
[02:52] <Strange> i got all these covered in one routine
[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == CTCP) { .ignore -tu $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) *!*@* }
[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == NOTICE) { .ignore -nu $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) *!*@* }
[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == WHISPER) { .ignore -pu $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) *!*@* }
[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == ACTION) { .ignore -u $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) $2 }
[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == PART) { .ignore -u $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) $2 }
[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == JOIN) { .ignore -u $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) $2 }

[02:52] <Strange> if ($1 == INVITE) { .ignore -iu $+ $master(settings,ignore.length) *!*@* }
[02:52] <optik> like even +o-o didnt effect it
[02:53] <Strange> i was good at doing that to people so i was good at not doing it myself lol
[02:53] <Strange> and MANY people would have loved to drop me opff a server
[02:53] <Strange> so it was that i HAD to be good at stopping it lol
[02:53] <Strange> the umm
[02:54] <Strange> i can tell you one way to drop this script
[02:54] <Strange> if the shitlist is on?
[02:54] <optik> oh the kick w/o ban thing
[02:54] <Strange> and you cycle clones with your ip the script can flood off trying to kick them
[02:54] <Strange> but i found a way to fix that too
[02:54] <Strange> i just check to make sure they are in the room before i kick now
[02:55] * Strange sets mode: +o NightDeath^
[02:55] <Strange> you can even stop the modes and umm joins and parts from showing
[02:55] <Strange> i love that shit it can be going all crazy around you and youll never see it lol
[02:56] <optik> lol
[02:56] <Strange> and all that flood control is automatic
[02:57] <Strange> thmirc added a cool thing
[02:57] <Strange> on the /echo command you can now put a -l to have highlight checking done
[02:58] <Strange> that saved me LOTS of code cause i had to add a bunch of iif($highlight($1-),this,that) to every line
[02:59] <optik> ic
[03:00] <Strange> /echo color -l #room Text
[03:00] <Strange> is the same as doing
[03:01] <Strange> oh shit it wont translate cause of control codes
[03:01] <Strange> but they still got a bug in the echo now cause it still beeps even if it isnt a highlight
[03:01] <Strange> if you have a sound defined in the highlight section whichj i do
[03:01] <optik> ic
[03:02] <Strange> sorry man im boring ya
[03:02] <optik> nah
[03:02] <optik> some of it goes over my head tho
[03:02] <optik> lol
[03:02] <Strange> well your coding right?
[03:02] <optik> yea
[03:02] <Strange> i have custom text as you know
[03:02] <Strange> so i define all my prompts ...
[03:03] <Strange> and to make it work like the normal ones you have to include a highlight check. well before you did
[03:03] <Strange> now they integrated it into the echo which means you take out a long line and replace it with -l
[03:04] <Strange> its a huge savins and because mirc does that internal its alot faster
[03:04] <Strange> if ($highlight == $true) { goto highlighting }
[03:04] <Strange> if ($master(settings,Query.Windows) == ON) {
[03:04] <Strange> if ($window(=$nick) == $null) { /query $nick }

[03:04] <Strange> if ($level($address($nick,3)) == 2) { echo $color(highlight) -t $nick $input  $+ %saved.color.friend $+ $lll $+ $white $nick  $+ %saved.color.friend $+ $rrr $+  $iif($chr(40) $+ $chr(35) $+ * $+ $chr(41) iswm $1,$2-,$1-) }

[03:04] <Strange> }
[03:05] <Strange> there used to be three more iif() statements in ecah of those lines
[03:05] <optik> ouch
[03:05] <Strange> opps thats the highlight off ones but same thing just a -lt instead of -t after $color(highlight)
[03:06] <Strange> and there are those lines for text (rtoom) text (whisper) text (dccchat) Action room and action whisper
[03:06] <Strange> so thats pretty huge savings form a small addition by mirc

[03:08] <optik> :/?
[03:08] <optik> lol
[03:08] <Strange> its basicly liek the highlight ceot you add words and if they are int he line you never see the line
[03:09] <optik> ohhhh
[03:09] <optik> like....
[03:09] <optik> when you filtered out my mp3 player msgs?

[03:09] <Strange> man that thing saves alot of anger
[03:10] <optik> คะarkene?
[03:10] <Strange> and i think its better than a ignore cause sometimes you want to see text.. just not all of it lol
[03:10] <Strange> maybe i should umm make it like the cuss cencor ... huh tim?
[03:11] <Strange> so you know the line was ignored?
[03:11] <Strange> make it say the nick and maybe something about being filtered ...
[03:11] <Strange> just retokenize the line with custom text

[03:27] <Strange> !quit
[03:27] <Strange> people do that?
[03:27] <optik> like alot of scripts where they know how to do that they use it
[03:27] <optik> oh yea
[03:27] <optik> and its a bitch
[03:27] <optik> coz u aint even on the same server as them
[03:27] <optik> and it wont let u part it
[03:27] <Strange> man i wouldnt use a script that did that who knows what else they they do
[03:27] <Strange> well you can always raw it
[03:27] <optik> and if u remove the shit for it theres a bunch of shit relying on it you need to fix all over
[03:28] <Strange> humm
[03:28] <Strange> ui did used to do one mean thing
[03:28] <Strange> my script kept a crc record
[03:28] <optik> crc?
[03:28] <Strange> and if someone edited it even one bit it would join my room and say"I'M AN ASSHOEL I EDITED YOUR SCRIPT " then quit and not run till they put it back
[03:29] <optik> LOL
[03:29] <Strange> yeah its the umm
[03:29] <Strange> $crc(text|&binvar|filename,[N])
[03:29] <Strange> Returns the CRC checksum of the specified item, where N = 0 for plain text, 1 for &binvar, 2 for filename (default).
[03:29] <Strange> you can crc ANY file
[03:30] <Strange> //say $crc mirc.exe)
[03:30] <Strange> //say $crc(mirc.exe)
[03:30] <Strange> DDB70776
[03:30] <Strange> and i did that to all my scripts
[03:30] <Strange> if any of them changed it would know
[03:30] <optik> so....
[03:31] <Strange> took them a few weeks to figure out how i had done it cause i triple
[03:31] <optik> couldnt you rightly re-get the crc and change what the script had to the new value?
[03:31] <Strange> i had threee checks and i did those sections of code in $chr() format
[03:31] <Strange> well i was the only one with the .do.crc code
[03:31] <Strange> i didnt put that part out with the script
[03:31] <optik> ah
[03:32] <Strange> if do.crc didnt run in so many seconds to keep the system "happy" it went into shut down
[03:32] <optik> lol
[03:32] <Strange> alias do.crc {  set %tmp.crc1 $crc($mircdirsystem\script0.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script1.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script2.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script3.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script4.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script5.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script6.ini) $+ , $+ $crc($mircdirsystem\script7.ini)  .write -nl4 $mircdirsystem\reload.txt %tmp.crc1  set %tmp.crc2 $crc($mircdirsystem\alias0.ini) $+ , $+ $crc
[03:32] <optik> see thats at least creative lol
[03:33] <optik> that locked room shit is just sad
[03:33] <optik> bbs
[03:33] <Strange> plus i make things so dam complicated that most people dont even bother to rip it ...
[03:33] <Strange> k
[03:33] <Strange> well i took that out cause it was to close to an exploit for me
[03:33] <optik> i messed with ripping some stuff way back
[03:33] <optik> and i looked at ur shit
[03:33] <optik> and truth be known
[03:33] <Strange> and i pride myself in that one fact that there is NO exploits or back doors to my coding
[03:33] <Strange> ?
[03:34] <optik> i cant even get command help out of there without asking you howd you do such and such
[03:34] <optik> like that scid thing
[03:34] <Strange> lol
[03:34] <optik> i knew u had it done somehow
[03:34] <optik> but as for looking for it shit

[23:21] <Strange> Updated action # and action ? events to use the users nick color in the custom prompt
[23:21] <Strange> Fixed an error in the custom prompts display. (all)
[23:21] <Strange> Added Actions ON/OFF to toggle 2 and added loggin if they are set off (like whispers and notices)
[23:21] <Strange> On the menu Channel, then Tools i fixed the option "set supported modes on room to use $chanmodes, which means it now gains its menu auto on logon.
[23:21] <NightDeath^> o0
[23:21] <Strange> I masked the 'the command IRCX is an Unknown command to me.' so it doesnt appear to be an error, this is auto IRCX detection failure reply. (just means the server is not ircx)

[02:26] <Strange> ok thats all good
[02:26] <Strange> you using the random button?
[02:27] <wolflord> yes
[02:27] <wolflord> G:\My Music\Aaron Tippin see thats the path to some of the music i have
[02:28] <Strange> well the script is designed to have all mp3 sources in that or a sub folder of it
[02:28] <Strange> it should play from naywhere
[02:28] <Strange> it was written to
[02:29] <Strange> but the random only draws from the base mp3 folder
[02:29] <Strange> those are the only songs it seens
[02:29] <Strange> sees*
[02:29] <Strange> same for the count
[02:29] <Strange> you can make it work by doing like i did and putting any other music in sub folders uner that music folder
[02:30] <Strange> then not only can they be randomized the count will include any sub folders

[02:40] <Strange> your behind
[02:40] <Strange> there is a new mirc
[02:41] <Strange> the script version matches mirc version

[02:42] <wolflord> ah
[02:42] <Strange> they released the update to fix exploits
[02:42] <Strange> your lucky tim isnt using them on you
[02:42] <Strange> uses StrangeScript v6.12.11.11.2003
[02:44] <wolflord> well i did get the new one but when i had to reformat i most have forgot it this time
[02:44] <Strange> v6.12 is what mirc the script is for... .11.11.2003 the build part of the version is simply what day i did /make for the update

[18:46] <frenchie> so the ip did work? we're mkaing progress then
[18:46] <frenchie> *making
[18:47] <frenchie> eek, brb
[18:47] <Strange> did
[18:47] <Strange> it worked by ip
[19:05] <frenchie> back
[19:08] <Strange> i added a new setting to the music player .. on off extra or local ..
[19:09] <Strange> dont know why i missed it before
[19:10] <frenchie> ah
[19:10] <frenchie> cool
[19:17] <frenchie> i discovered that someone else on campus uses (or at least has) simple dns so i'm deciding to check it out
[19:17] <frenchie> lol
[19:26] <Strange> oh yeah it works ok
[19:26] <Strange> it does the job
[19:26] <frenchie> just have to figure out how to use it!
[19:26] <frenchie> hehe
[19:54] <frenchie> ok, now i'm ready to work with simple dns
[19:55] <frenchie> think i'll be able to figure it out
[20:06] <frenchie> so there's 2 steps... registering www.yourname.com, and then actually working out the ip? and simpledns only does the 2nd, right?
[20:08] <Strange> simple dns doenst register the domain
[20:08] <Strange> it only manages them for you
[20:08] <Strange> you still have to have a provider of sorts
[20:08] <Strange> i use stargate.com
[20:08] <Strange> and with them i manage my strangeout.com
[20:09] <Strange> i added a host .ns1.strangeout.com which is my name server (mer)
[20:09] <Strange> me
[20:09] <Strange> then with my dns program (bind) i control and assign ips to the strangeout domain
[20:09] <Strange> and others
[20:10] <Strange> the first one is done frenchie
[20:10] <Strange> just so you know
[20:11] <frenchie> hehe

[22:14] <Strange> seems it
[22:18] <frenchie> doesn't take much for you to find a reason to edit
[22:19] <Strange> yeah the script is old..
[22:19] <Strange> to try to keep it fun i like to update it
[22:19] <Strange> its hard cause its huge
[22:19] <Strange> liekt his little change has hundreds of entries
[22:20] <Strange> back when i started i used a $acecho alias .... then i switched displays to my $report() type btu i didnt change the ones that had to be room spific
[22:20] <Strange> so Im doing those but there are sure alot oif them to do
[22:21] <Strange> but when im done finally all prompts can pass through the one $report alias
[22:21] <Strange> easy now to change the look and feel or find the error

[22:33] <Strange> weird
[22:33] <Strange> seesm liek the servers watch list isnt working
[22:33] <frenchie> ?
[22:33] <Strange> unreal has an added one called watch
[22:33] <Strange> /helpop ?watch
[22:34] <Strange> you have to put the ? infront cause of yoru status
[22:34] <Strange> and i cant seem to get it to respond
[22:34] <Strange> its a new notify system
[22:34] <frenchie> came up for me
[22:34] <frenchie> well, the helpop
[22:35] <frenchie> it says it doesn't remain between sessions...
[22:35] <Strange> yeah but i tried to add one
[22:35] <Strange> a nick and still got5 no response
[22:36] <Strange> it may be that my script isnt tuned to see the response
[22:36] <Strange> debug @debug
[22:36] <Strange> yep thats it
[22:36] <Strange> it appears to answer auto with notify
[22:37] <Strange> i did watch and the ones in my notify list showed up
[22:37] <Strange> -> strangeout.com WATCH
[22:37] <Strange> <- :strangeout.com 604 Strange Strange author strangeout.com 1068681343 :is online
[22:37] <Strange> <- :strangeout.com 604 Strange Cognizant Cognizant 4456V9A.Q61386.53499Y5.IP 1068090543 :is online
[22:37] <Strange> <- :strangeout.com 607 Strange :End of WATCH l
[22:37] <Strange> just weird we dont se the raw somewhere
[22:38] <Strange> unless when you filter names and all that in the new mirc it does more than that
[22:38] <Strange> <- :strangeout.com 603 Strange :You have 26 and are on 1 WATCH entries
[22:39] <Strange> thats one of the raws returned from notify
[22:39] <Strange> man there is so much i coulddo lol
[22:39] <Strange> mirc must handle it auto i guess but we dont get all that info soooo. we will now
[22:40] <Strange> 604 == online
[22:40] <Strange> 605 == offline
[22:40] <Strange> yeah mirc knows watch ...
[22:40] <Strange> so if thats available it uses it instead of notify auto
[22:44] <Strange> so we can just update the notify section :)
[22:44] <Strange> k? lol
[22:47] <Strange> //say $mnick
[22:47] <Strange> Strange
[22:47] <Strange> ouch
[22:48] <Strange> thats another thing to move to miorc settings now too
[22:48] <Strange> and ditch setting it in the script i guess
[22:48] <Strange> if mirc has a command to set those fromt he session that is
[22:49] <frenchie> frenchie
[22:49] <frenchie> ChiefsAre9-0
[22:49] <frenchie> heh, that shouldn't be my alt nick
[22:49] <frenchie> altho its a good one
[22:49] <frenchie> :p
[22:50] <Strange> lol
[22:50] <Strange> im pretty sure there is a command to set them
[22:51] <Strange> though my script has a server independant list which i like
[22:51] <Strange> you still got to start with that one and im trying to move as many settings out of the script and into mirc settings as i can
[22:51] <Strange> to centralize it more
[22:51] <frenchie> ya
[22:51] <frenchie> seems logical enough
[22:51] <frenchie> :)
[22:52] <Strange> its sort of hard to find stuff in here
[22:52] <Strange> there is so much
[22:52] <Strange> and its confusing to many peopl;e
[22:52] <Strange> course before i liked weeding out the weak
[22:52] <Strange> was sort of a goal
[22:53] <frenchie> lol
[22:54] <Strange> i got one error i havent been able to fix yet
[22:54] <Strange> i do haltdef in the :NOTIFY: section
[22:54] <Strange> so if i comment out the raw whois ... it doesnt seem to whois like it should but if i put it on it does it twice...
[22:55] <Strange> like the default action is going out at the same time ...
[22:55] <Strange> though im aiming to control it all myself....
[22:55] <Strange> i meant whois
[22:56] <Strange> if ($notify($nick).whois == $true) { whois $nick } if ($notify($nick).whois == $true) { whois $nick }
[22:56] <Strange> opps
[22:56] <Strange> if ($notify($nick).whois == $true) { whois $nick }
[22:56] <Strange> should only do it once but it does it twice ... have never figured out why
[22:56] <Strange> did you know....
[22:57] <Strange> that the script can auto invite people in your notify list to a room
[22:57] <frenchie> heh
[22:57] <frenchie> cool
[22:57] <frenchie> lol
[22:57] <Strange> if their note sare INVITE #roomname
[22:57] <Strange> it can also ghost someone auto
[22:57] <Strange> if ($gettok($notify($nick).note,1,32) == INVITE) && ($nick !ison $gettok($notify($nick).note,2,32) && ($me !ison $gettok($notify($nick).note,2,32)) { .invite $nick $gettok($notify($nick).note,2,32) }
[22:57] <Strange> if ($gettok($notify($nick).note,1,32) == GHOST) && ($nick != $me) { $ss.services $ss.nickserv ghost $nick $readini($textdir $+ PassWord.ini,n,$network,$nick) }
[22:57] <Strange> if your in the room and they arent it will invite them
[22:58] <Strange> there are hundreds of undocumented features like that
[22:58] <frenchie> nice
[22:59] <Strange> hundreds , they are everywhere
[22:59] <Strange> lol does appear that i am an excessive coder dont it

[23:01] <Strange> guess i should get a life o0
[23:02] <Strange> dont matter where i put that damn line it still notifies twice
[23:02] <Strange> //say $notify(strange).whois
[23:02] <Strange> $true
[23:03] <Strange> time to debug *sigh
[23:03] <frenchie> hehe
[23:03] <frenchie> u know u love it!
[23:04] <Strange> think i fixed it
[23:04] <Strange> yeha i do love coding , and if i do say so myself im pretty fucking good at it
[23:05] <Strange> i can make mirc stand on its head and spin .... o0
[23:06] <Strange> ouch
[23:06] <Strange> man that was rough
[23:06] <Strange> umm i forgot the AV auto scans files
[23:06] <Strange> it even does MIRC dcc files
[23:06] <Strange> so mirc was locked up waiting to save that transfer while norton was scanning it
[23:07] <Strange> it at least pops up a box (av does) that says "mirc is waiting on a virus scan of filename"
[23:07] <Strange> they did a really nice job with this nortons
[23:08] <Strange> and thansk i got it :)
[23:08] <Strange> hey thats cool
[23:08] <Strange> guess what
[23:09] <Strange> i thinbk iv found a way to see if anyone has YOU on notify
[23:09] <Strange> lol
[23:09] <Strange> neat
[23:10] <frenchie> oooo
[23:10] <frenchie> neat0o
[23:10] <frenchie> neat-o
[23:10] <Strange> ill add it and test it on dalnet i bet i got a bunch watching me there
[23:10] <frenchie> and yw :)
[23:10] <frenchie> haha
[23:10] <Strange> thats what the raw said
[23:10] <Strange> and are on 1 WATCH entries
[23:10] <Strange> which here is myown but still
[23:11] <Strange> /me loves info
[23:11] <frenchie> hm, how do you add someone to the watch list?
[23:11] <frenchie> just regular notify?
[23:12] <Strange> yes
[23:12] <Strange> i see now that mirc knows about watch
[23:12] <Strange> so adding them to notify is == to watch list
[23:12] <frenchie> ok...are you on my watch list??
[23:12] <Strange> the returns are the same
[23:12] * frenchie giggles
[23:12] <Strange> am i?
[23:12] <Strange> i dont know ...
[23:12] <Strange> ill check

[23:13] <Strange> im working that out to tattle show up after the whois's are done
[23:14] <Strange> need to ditch the nick huh
[23:15] <Strange> now to test it on dalnet
[23:15] <Strange> server -m dalnet -i Strange`
[23:16] <Strange> did you see the umm ah never mind most people wont care
[23:16] <Strange> i added an auto event on the tools menu ..
[23:16] <Strange> it pick up the raw 5 info and inserts them into the menu auto
[23:16] <Strange> in the set suupported modes on room menu
[23:17] <frenchie> run that by me once more...
[23:17] <Strange> that manu with alll the letters is auto generated
[23:17] <Strange> on the channel menu
[23:17] <Strange> then tools
[23:17] <Strange> then set suupported modes on room menu
[23:17] <Strange> that menu reads the RAW 005 connection info and generates that menu automaticly and server independant
[23:18] <frenchie> ah
[23:18] <frenchie> cool
[23:18] <frenchie> never noticed that
[23:18] <frenchie> :)
[23:18] <Strange> lol
[23:18] <Strange> see

[23:22] <frenchie> LoL
[23:22] <frenchie> cuz of simple dns
[23:22] <frenchie> ...
[23:23] <Strange> na thats them
[23:23] <Strange> thats what i got
[23:23] <Strange> thats why i came online here
[23:23] <Strange> with my dal nick
[23:23] <frenchie> o
[23:23] <Strange> simple works good
[23:23] <Strange> you can trust its replies
[23:23] <frenchie> thought it was simpledns since that's my dns server now
[23:24] <Strange> do you have it set to forward ?
[23:24] <Strange> or like you should to get ips off the root
[23:24] <Strange> you will have to change your wall
[23:25] <Strange> umm i can show you my rules that aloow dns to work
[23:26] <Strange> there is three of them
[23:26] <Strange> UDP any host port 53 to port <1023
[23:26] <Strange> udp any host port 53 to port 53
[23:27] <Strange> udp any host port >1023 to port 53
[23:27] <Strange> the bottom two are in the top one is replys to your requests
[23:27] <Strange> those would be inplace of the ip specific ones we added for your campus servers
[23:28] <Strange> when you run your own dns server it first goews to root to see who controls it
[23:28] <Strange> then goers to that server and gets info and if its reassigned then to that server and gets it
[23:28] <Strange> can take a few requests to get athe info ...
[23:29] <Strange> to get my info .. its like 3 i think
[23:29] <Strange> first the root then stargate then me
[23:30] <Strange> next year when i add the other servers
[23:30] <Strange> im gonna pull the whole shabang into me
[23:30] <Strange> i will probibly register a new domain
[23:30] <Strange> and control the whole thing from here
[23:31] <Strange> anyway back to how to change the settings of mnick'
[23:31] <Strange> if you can read it you should be able to set it

[00:53] <NightDeath^> i didnt read it tho
[00:53] <NightDeath^> lol
[00:53] <Strange> well i assumed that cause of the lack of 'lol'
[00:53] <NightDeath^> lol
[00:54] <NightDeath^> strange, you dont know why my this script is doing that when my other mirc speaks?
[00:54] <Strange> umm
[00:54] <Strange> its got an # in the clip
[00:54] <Strange> # is translated to current room name
[00:54] <Strange> in mirc
[00:55] <Strange> if your putting a # in the text then its wise to remove it i guess
[00:55] <Strange> as you might know ...
[00:55] <NightDeath^> no #
[00:55] <Strange> got to be
[00:55] <NightDeath^> and its even coming up like i am saying it
[00:55] <NightDeath^> its coming up red
[00:55] <Strange> o0
[00:55] <Strange> what script
[00:55] <Strange> mine?
[00:56] <NightDeath^> yeah
[00:56] <Strange> is coming up with a room name in the text?
[00:56] <NightDeath^> this is strangescript
[00:56] <NightDeath> this is sceptrescript
[00:56] <NightDeath^> yes
[00:56] <Strange> its showing a room name in the text prompts on your screen now?
[00:56] <NightDeath^> (16:55:32)   บ( Strange )บ is coming up with a room name in the text?
[00:56] <Strange> like by my name ?
[00:56] <NightDeath^> (16:55:35)   บ( NightDeath^ )บ this is strangescript
[00:56] <NightDeath^> (16:55:43) #StrangeOut   บ( NightDeath )บ this is sceptrescript
[00:56] <NightDeath^> not by yours
[00:56] <NightDeath^> just my other mirc....
[00:56] <Strange> by what one?
[00:56] <Strange> then its got to be that script
[00:57] <NightDeath^> just when my SceptreScript
[00:57] <Strange> and my current support level for other scritps is negative 1000
[00:57] <NightDeath^> but is was working fine before....
[00:57] <NightDeath^> its not SceptreScript
[00:57] <NightDeath^> its your script
[00:57] <NightDeath^> cuz its showing in your script.....
[00:57] <Strange> oh man you said the magic words
[00:58] <Strange> mines working fine dude
[00:58] <NightDeath^> i did?
[00:58] <Strange> oh yeah .. its yoru script
[00:58] <NightDeath^> imeant StrangeScript
[00:58] <NightDeath^> o0
[00:58] <NightDeath^> i give up
[00:58] <Strange> those are trigger words when they are lacking key discvlaimers like "i believe" or "could it be"
[00:58] * frenchie is sooooooooooooooooooooooo confused
[00:59] <Strange> i have no idea whats hes talking about but somehow its 'my script
[00:59] <NightDeath^> i believe
[00:59] <Strange> so ill suggest you /quit it delete it and save yoruself the trouble of running such a fucked up scipt as mine
[01:00] <NightDeath^> ok, shh. i will explain for a minute
[01:00] <Strange> i mean really who would want such a piece of shit anyway
[01:00] <Strange> besides me any i mean
[01:01] <Strange> you want to know how to debug?
[01:01] <Strange> so you can see the raw text and see what one is actually doing it?
[01:01] <NightDeath^> for some odd reason, the other mirc i am running atm on this server wich is my old script Sceptrescript shows in the script the room #strangeout and it looks like me thats saying it......
[01:01] <NightDeath^> no
[01:02] <NightDeath^> that makes no sence either
[01:02] <Strange> yes it does...
[01:02] <Strange> ok fine man lol
[01:02] <Strange> roundie round we gooooooo
[01:02] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:02] <NightDeath^> ok
[01:02] <Strange> time for some dope , tim will be here soon
[01:02] <Strange> and lord knows when that boy gets to talking the dope will come in handy i say
[01:03] <Strange> mirc has a mthod for displaying raw in and output
[01:03] <Strange> so you can debug scripts
[01:03] <NightDeath^> when someone else but this script talks in the room it looks like this (17:02:06)   บ( Strange )บ time for some dope , tim will be here soon
[01:03] <NightDeath^> and when i talk with this script
[01:03] <NightDeath^> it looks like
[01:03] <NightDeath^> (17:01:55)   บ( NightDeath^ )บ lol
[01:04] <Strange> so only when your script talks does it look goofed
[01:04] <Strange> how is that stranges fault?
[01:04] <NightDeath^> and for some reason the OTHER mirc looks like (16:51:12) #StrangeOut   บ( NightDeath )บ testing123123123
[01:05] <NightDeath^> well it wasnt looking like that before
[01:05] <NightDeath^> it was looking normal other persons talk
[01:05] <Strange> well im just pointing out that its notas you stated
[01:05] <NightDeath^> see (16:12:08)   บ( NightDeath )บ lol
[01:05] <Strange> thats my script
[01:06] <Strange> its working fine
[01:06] <NightDeath^> yes...
[01:06] <Strange> you said it was my script
[01:06] <Strange> WRONG
[01:06] <NightDeath^> ?
[01:06] <NightDeath^> your sonfusing me
[01:06] <Strange> lets do it this way
[01:06] <Strange> when you talk with strange its fine
[01:06] <NightDeath^> its MY script on this computer wich is StrangeScript wich is YOUR script.....
[01:06] <Strange> it looks fine in my scirpt
[01:07] <Strange> omg
[01:07] <Strange> umm
[01:07] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:07] <Strange> i see
[01:07] <Strange> lets start here
[01:07] <Strange> talk from thew one that is displaying wrong
[01:07] <NightDeath> talking
[01:08] <Strange> ok is that my scirpt
[01:08] <NightDeath^> no, thats SceptreScript
[01:08] <Strange> is the one your talking from StrangeScript?
[01:08] <Strange> you can feel free to answer ... and yes and no would do
[01:08] <NightDeath^> this is the StrangeScript one
[01:08] <Strange> o0
[01:08] <Strange> your not following simple directions
[01:09] <Strange> so ill assume that the one without the ^ is NOT MY SCRIPT
[01:09] <NightDeath^> that correct
[01:09] <Strange> then its just that ...
[01:09] <Strange> as i said the problem is in the other script
[01:09] <Strange> not mine ...
[01:10] <Strange> the other one has to be incorrectly formatting the text to add an #
[01:10] <NightDeath^> but its displaying wrong wrong here in StrangeScript when i talk with SceptreScript
[01:11] <Strange> if you tried to rip the :TEXT: event then somewhere in it you screwed the pooch
[01:11] <NightDeath^> i havent tried to rip anything....
[01:11] <Strange> rip is an expression
[01:11] <Strange> we rip cd's
[01:11] <Strange> we rip movies
[01:11] <Strange> we rip ... oh never mind
[01:12] <Strange> your ripping it if you turned off mircs default text using ^*:EVENT or the haltdef
[01:12] <NightDeath^> like i was saying.....it was displaying right before
[01:12] <Strange> well i cant help it if YORU scritp isnt displaying right
[01:12] <Strange> our is
[01:12] <Strange> all of ours is
[01:13] <Strange> evern your "ours" is
[01:13] <Strange> meaning mine that you use
[01:13] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:13] <Strange> so how can your scripts display be on me?
[01:13] <NightDeath^> this conversation is very fucken confusing
[01:13] <Strange> if mine was doing it in the text sends to the room we all would see it
[01:14] <NightDeath^> you dont understand me at all..................
[01:14] <Strange> ok feel free to try again while i shoot up some drano ...
[01:15] <Strange> thats a joke man...
[01:15] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:15] <NightDeath^> i know
[01:15] <Strange> ok your seeing the bad text in strangescript
[01:15] <Strange> correct?
[01:15] <NightDeath^> i am just having a smoke thinking of how i can explain this to you without confusing myself and you
[01:15] <Strange> and only when your script is the one talking right?
[01:15] <NightDeath^> correct
[01:15] <NightDeath^> right
[01:16] <Strange> umm one sec
[01:16] <Strange> i may have an answer for you
[01:16] <NightDeath^> thats nice, may i please hear it?
[01:16] <Strange> is highlighting on?
[01:16] <Strange> or off
[01:16] <NightDeath^> wheres that at?
[01:17] <NightDeath^> o0
[01:17] <Strange> //say $highlight
[01:17] <Strange> $true
[01:17] <NightDeath^> $true
[01:17] <Strange> it is in fact my script you win
[01:17] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:17] <Strange> the level 5
[01:17] <Strange> is missing the required ($nick != $me
[01:18] <Strange> are you happening to see the text double?
[01:18] <Strange> are you seeing the line twice>
[01:18] <NightDeath^> no
[01:18] * ouch (StrangeOut@strangeout.com) has joined #StrangeOut
[01:18] <NightDeath^> just the once
[01:18] <ouch> test
[01:18] <NightDeath^> with the # in it

[01:19] <ouch> (01:18:58) #StrangeOut บ( ouch )บ test
[01:19] <NightDeath^> yesh
[01:19] * ouch (author@strangeout.com) Quit (strangeout.com)
[01:19] <NightDeath^> ?
[01:19] <Strange> yeah ok
[01:19] <Strange> very fixable and my fault'
[01:19] <Strange> thats a rewrite issue
[01:20] <NightDeath^> ok
[01:20] <Strange> god sometimes your to good at finding bugs ... excuse me while i mumble prick and go fix this
[01:20] <NightDeath^> lmao!!
[01:20] <NightDeath^> i find them by accedent
[01:20] <Strange> this is all yoru missing
[01:20] <Strange> && ($nick != $me)
[01:21] <Strange> in a few places
[01:21] <Strange> wondered why i had that in there in the past....
[01:21] <Strange> guess i got a refresher course
[01:22] <Strange> thats cause the other session has the exact same ip
[01:22] <Strange> so it views it as a level 5
[01:23] <NightDeath^> ahh
[01:23] <Strange> that means it was displaying the text to $active screen .
[01:23] <Strange> but was formatted for a $report().chan
[01:23] * ouch (StrangeOut@strangeout.com) has joined #StrangeOut
[01:23] <ouch> fare out man
[01:24] <Strange> see i cant even see that here like i should
[01:24] * ouch (author@strangeout.com) Quit (strangeout.com)
[01:24] <Strange> humm
[01:25] <NightDeath^> atleast we got the confusion outta the way
[01:25] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:25] <Strange> makes it even more complicated like i just did it cause both sessions are infact $me
[01:25] <Strange> thats a futherence of the same bug
[01:25] <Strange> cause i logged onto the same server with the same script just two sessions
[01:26] <Strange> damnit
[01:26] <NightDeath^> lol
[01:26] <Strange> so i guess this fix wil help you
[01:26] <Strange> but its not good enough for me
[01:26] <Strange> so ill have to do better brb
[01:27] * ouch (StrangeOut@strangeout.com) has joined #StrangeOut
[01:27] <ouch> take that

[01:29] <Strange> you can edit yours to fix it for now if you like
[01:29] <Strange> ill show ya what to search for

[01:31] <NightDeath^> sorry
[01:31] <Strange> np
[01:31] <NightDeath^> i was brushing the cat
[01:31] <Strange> open the editor
[01:31] <Strange> to remotes
[01:31] <Strange> search :TEST
[01:31] <NightDeath^> open
[01:31] <Strange> opps
[01:31] <Strange> search :TEXT
[01:31] <Strange> there is two text events
[01:32] <Strange> one has a # one has a ?
[01:32] <Strange> you want the one that is #
[01:32] <NightDeath^> on ^*:TEXT:*:#: {
[01:32] <Strange> correct
[01:32] <NightDeath^> ok
[01:32] <Strange> down in that youll see two segments
[01:32] <Strange> if ($highlight == $true) { goto highlighting }
[01:32] <Strange> :nohighlight
[01:32] <Strange> m
[01:32] <Strange> an
[01:32] <Strange> if ($highlight == $true) { goto highlighting }
[01:32] <Strange> :nohighlight
[01:33] <Strange> the line JUST below :nohighlight
[01:33] <Strange> is level 5
[01:33] <Strange> thats one is the one to edit
[01:33] <Strange> first
[01:33] <Strange> in that line youll see an -at
[01:33] <Strange> remove the a to make it just -t
[01:33] <Strange> then...
[01:34] <Strange> youll see it read if ($level($address($nick,3)) == 5) {
[01:34] <Strange> make it now read
[01:34] <Strange> ($level($address($nick,3)) == 5) && ($nick != $me) {
[01:34] <Strange> then do the same for the level 5 in the hoghlight section
[01:35] <Strange> :highlighting
[01:35] <Strange> if ($level($address($nick,3)) == 5) && ($nick != $me) { echo -lt # $output  $+ %saved.color.me $+ $lll $+ $white $nick  $+ %saved.color.me $+ $rrr $+  $iif($chr(40) $+ $chr(35) $+ * $+ $chr(41) iswm $1,$2-,$1-) | goto bail }
[01:35] <Strange> just take out the a
[01:35] <Strange> and add that little check to make sure other sessions on the same server/same mirc dont cross contaminate
[01:36] <Strange> thats all folks
[01:36] <NightDeath> ...
[01:36] <NightDeath^> that works
[01:36] <Strange> i added the smae cross check to all the text events but they wont effect you .. and youll get them in the update
[01:36] <NightDeath^> took away the #strangeout
[01:36] <NightDeath^> but
[01:36] <NightDeath^> its still the same colour as mine....
[01:36] <Strange> colors ?

[05:02] <Strange-out> The Red Hat Linux Project, as this used to be called, is merging with the Fedora Linux project. We had so many common goals that to work apart would be a waste of effort. We have months of effort before we can have a unified infrastructure, so we still have two different web sites, two sets of documentation, and so forth, but we will be unifying our work over time. Red Hat would like to thank Fedora Linux project developers for proposing the merger a
[05:02] <Strange-out> Another objective of The Fedora Project is to be widely available and freely redistributable. Each release of Fedora Core will be available for free download via FTP and other distribution mechanisms (for example, BitTorrent). Anyone interested in using, developing, testing, or evaluating Fedora Core is encouraged to download the latest version (or the latest test release if available) and try it.

[02:03] <Strange> im cool ask away frenchie
[02:03] <Strange> always got time for a question
[02:03] <Strange> have you time for the answer ?
[02:03] <Strange> :)
[02:04] <Strange> umm but im gonna reboot this server after we settle it cause i goofed norton ... : Incompatible version of SYMEVENT.SYS is loaded.
[02:04] <frenchie> \\:(\\\\14/11/2003:)|:)|TV-RiPS|/:(:(:>\\CRiMSON/||/:>:(:):)08:01:34:(:):)/Friends.S10E07.SVCD.PROPER-CRiMSON\\\\):\\
[02:04] <rdc> echo "RDC is the greatest man alive!" 
[02:04] <frenchie> that's the string being brought in
[02:04] <frenchie> or something along the lines of it
[02:04] <Strange> brought in?
[02:05] <frenchie> and i need to get rid of :/\()|
[02:05] <frenchie> all the random stuff in there
[02:05] <Strange> whats the question?
[02:05] <Strange> i missed it somehow
[02:05] <Strange> that long line then ...
[02:05] <Strange> (02:04:36) บ( frenchie )บ that's the string being brought in
[02:05] <Strange> (02:04:43) บ( frenchie )บ or something along the lines of it
[02:05] <frenchie> //say $remove(\\:(\\\\14/11/2003:)|:)|TV-RiPS|/:(:(:>\\CRiMSON/||/:>:(:):)08:01:34:(:):)/Friends.S10E07.SVCD.PROPER-CRiMSON\\\\):\\,|/\:)
[02:06] <Strange> you said AND you need to get rid of the chars
[02:06] <frenchie> i want to remove the : / \ < > | ( ) characters from that string
[02:06] <Strange> yuor values must be in $chr()
[02:06] <Strange> in the end section
[02:07] <Strange> and i do believe seperated by comma's
[02:07] <frenchie> %tmp.scon.n = $remove(%tmp.scon.n,|)
[02:07] <Strange> 124
[02:07] <Strange> //say $asc(|)
[02:07] <frenchie> %tmp.scon.n originally being the colored line i pasted
[02:07] <frenchie> but even that doesn't work
[02:07] <Strange> 105
[02:07] <Strange> i can show you
[02:07] <frenchie> it gives me invalid format
[02:08] <Strange> 58
[02:08] <frenchie> i thought maybe the ( ) confuse the syntax
[02:08] <Strange> 124,58,
[02:08] <Strange> na it looks only for the comma
[02:08] <frenchie> \\:(\\\\14/11/2003:)|
[02:08] <Strange> 47
[02:08] <Strange> 92
[02:10] <Strange> umm i see
[02:10] <Strange> one sec still testing
[02:10] <frenchie> 124
[02:10] <frenchie> ://\\
[02:10] <frenchie> ://()\\
[02:11] <frenchie> aaaah
[02:11] <frenchie> //say $remove(://(|)\\,$chr(124))
[02:11] <Strange> yeah i see that issue
[02:12] <Strange> well arent you the good one ... only puzzle that would keep me trying
[02:12] <frenchie> so what if the string had commas in it...
[02:13] <Strange> then it looks after each one
[02:13] <Strange> //raw privmsg # : $+ $remove( [ \\:(\\\\14/11/2003:)|:)|TV-RiPS|/:(:(:>\\CRiMSON/||/:>:(:):)08:01:34:(:):)/Friends.S10E07.SVCD.PROPER-CRiMSON\\\\):\\ ] ,$chr(92), $chr(47), $chr(58), $chr(124))
[02:13] <Strange> thats how im working it
[02:13] <Strange> without the [ ] of course
[02:13] <Strange> //raw privmsg # : $+ $remove(\\:(\\\\14/11/2003:)|:)|TV-RiPS|/:(:(:>\\CRiMSON/||/:>:(:):)08:01:34:(:):)/Friends.S10E07.SVCD.PROPER-CRiMSON\\\\):\\,$chr(92), $chr(47), $chr(58), $chr(124))
[02:13] <Strange> still remove does seem to have an issue witht he 90
[02:13] <Strange> i mnean ()
[02:14] <Strange> maybe if you replaced the ( and ) with something else
[02:14] <Strange> then removed
[02:14] <Strange> then returned it to its original state
[02:14] <frenchie> hmm
[02:15] <Strange> 91 and 93
[02:15] <Strange> nope
[02:16] <Strange> wont see to take a string
[02:16] <Strange> sooo
[02:16] <Strange> this may have to be a binvar
[02:17] <Strange> umm you actually stupped me for a sec here
[02:17] <Strange> +m
[02:18] <Strange> i mean mirc can do any fricking thing so it can do this but ive not tried to work a string from hell
[02:18] <Strange> now i know why i never liked them weird chars in a script ...
[02:20] <Strange> /breplace <&binvar> <oldvalue> <newvalue> [oldvalue newvalue...]
[02:20] <Strange> This replaces all matching ascii values in &binvar with new values.
[02:20] <frenchie> yeah, we're echoing this from a bot in an invite only channel, to our own channel
[02:20] <Strange> if you handle it liek a file should work fine
[02:20] <frenchie> we're just trying to get rid of all those extra chars that aren't necessary
[02:20] <Strange> look up binary variables in /help
[02:20] <frenchie> k
[02:21] <Strange> you need bwrite bread and breplace
[02:21] <Strange> it is literally &same.as.a.variable
[02:22] <Strange> lots of funtions there
[02:22] <frenchie> [
[02:22] <frenchie> oops
[02:22] <frenchie> lol
[02:22] <Strange> let me get this machien set up.... its a birthday present and i have to have it to them at 8 am

[02:26] <frenchie> indeed it is
[02:26] <Strange> need a .stopwatch
[02:26] <Strange> thats my only beef about irc
[02:27] <Strange> id like my users to display in the same line by their niock
[02:27] <Strange> nick
[02:27] <Strange> instead of a scrolling screen
[02:27] <Strange> maybe ill code in a line for the bot...
[02:28] <Strange> so his text could do more clever things, more like a display update then room text .... ahhh never mind ill show ya someday
[02:28] <Strange> oh
[02:28] <frenchie> heh
[02:28] <Strange> did you see the paste
[02:28] <frenchie> about?
[02:28] <Strange> redhat merged with fedora
[02:29] <Strange> there is a new linux by them thats free
[02:29] <frenchie> didn't see
[02:29] <Strange> let me pull up the mail
[02:30] <Strange> http://fedora.redhat.com/
[02:30] <Strange> i downloaded it last night
[02:30] <Strange> havent installed it yet
[02:30] <Strange> i guess from what i see thats the new free one....
[02:30] <Strange> not sure yet but ...
[02:30] <Strange> ill see
[02:30] <Strange> What are the differences between Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Fedora Project? And how do they differ from the Red Hat Linux you've been using for years?
[02:30] <Strange> See a complete comparison:
[02:30] <Strange> http://www.redhat.com/software/rhelorfedora/
[02:30] <Strange> ENTERPRISE LINUX
[02:30] <Strange> If you're a business, government, or are just looking for a stable, supported Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the clear choice.
[02:30] <Strange> FEDORA PROJECT
[02:30] <Strange> If you're a developer or technology enthusiast, the Fedora Project -- a proving ground for new Linux and open source technology -- may be what you want.
[02:32] <Strange> maybe they are really putting a new spin on linux ... hope its worht a crap
[02:32] <frenchie> interesting
[02:32] <Strange> ok machien time brb
[02:35] <frenchie> i'm off to bed
[02:35] <frenchie> thx

[02:38] <Strange> humm
[02:38] <Strange> all at once?
[02:39] <Strange> all random ports?
[02:39] <Strange> sounds like the signs of infection or someone in a lab somewhere looking to lose his log in priv. lol
[02:39] <frenchie> it seems like the goal is 1 ip scans a port 5 times
[02:40] <Strange> humm
[02:40] <frenchie> then another ip does the next port in succession 5 times
[02:40] <frenchie> etc
[02:40] <Strange> wow
[02:40] <frenchie> a few of them are out of order
[02:40] <frenchie> but that's what it looks like
[02:40] <Strange> womeone has access to a good setup
[02:40] <Strange> tcp?
[02:40] <Strange> trying to connect to a certian ip?
[02:40] <Strange> i mean rge
[02:40] <Strange> range*
[02:41] <Strange> there is an attack similar to that but normally its more ips than 5
[02:41] <Strange> they could very well be spoofed ips

[11:29] <Strange> wow
[11:29] <Strange> passed right out
[11:33] <frenchie> morning
[11:33] <frenchie> :)
[11:34] <Strange> morning
[11:34] <Strange> i didnt mean to pass out
[11:34] <Strange> umm they still scanning ya?
[11:34] <frenchie> yes
[11:34] <Strange> could be a geek down at tech too ya know
[11:34] <frenchie> a couple of the ips are different
[11:34] <Strange> they are report them to tech they will shutdown the machines
[11:35] <frenchie> oh i'm pretty sure its someone from tech services
[11:35] <frenchie> why else would they be scanning my machine for 12 hours?
[11:35] <frenchie> and they're only scanning ports 3000-5000
[11:35] <Strange> what can they do
[11:35] <Strange> you got anything on that port?
[11:35] <Strange> close up what ya got
[11:36] <Strange> like iurc
[11:36] <Strange> irc set irc wall entries from open to drop
[11:36] <Strange> anything in that range
[11:36] <Strange> then juist ignore them
[11:36] <Strange> or scan them back lol
[11:36] <Strange> fuck um
[11:37] <Strange> i thiunk
[11:37] <Strange> your better off
[11:37] <Strange> setting all local ips
[11:37] <Strange> to ignore
[11:37] <Strange> then they cant connect even if the port ios open
[11:37] <frenchie> well, you put in that drop rule
[11:37] <Strange> just make a rule dropping all local traffic
[11:37] <Strange> for locals?
[11:37] <Strange> yeah
[11:37] <Strange> cool
[11:38] <frenchie> the only one above that i have is anything coming from campus port 80
[11:38] <Strange> then they cant touch you no matter whats open
[11:38] <frenchie> cuz i couldn't access any webpages
[11:38] <Strange> (to the rest of the world)
[11:38] <Strange> o0
[11:38] <Strange> oh yeah
[11:38] <Strange> i see
[11:38] <frenchie> everything else above that is a specific campus ip to a specific port
[11:38] <frenchie> so unless they start using port 80
[11:38] <frenchie> i'm good

[11:39] <frenchie> o
[11:39] <frenchie> well
[11:39] <frenchie> they can get into 1 port
[11:39] <frenchie> my remote access port
[11:39] <frenchie> but that's not bad
[11:39] <frenchie> i'm allowed to remote into my comp from work
[11:39] <frenchie> heh
[11:39] <Strange> cool
[11:40] <frenchie> what's the diff between drop and deny?
[11:40] <Strange> denty send s a return packet
[11:40] <Strange> like connection refused is a deny
[11:40] <frenchie> ah
[11:40] <Strange> drop silently drops it
[11:40] <frenchie> cool
[11:41] <frenchie> i just wanna know wtf they're trying to do
[11:41] <frenchie> heh
[11:41] <frenchie> cuz its annoying ;)
[11:44] <Strange> well get used to people scanning and packeting lol
[11:44] <Strange> if i went crazy every time someone did that to me id be mad 1000 times over
[11:44] <Strange> when it happenes to me
[11:45] <Strange> i put the ip at the top blocked ... or range
[11:45] <Strange> and make sure it doesnt log cause logging slows you way down
[11:45] <Strange> then forget them
[11:45] <frenchie> lol
[11:45] <frenchie> but the ips change
[11:45] <Strange> once blocked i know they aint getting in .. so f um
[11:46] <frenchie> well, once i coudl understand
[11:46] <frenchie> its the repetetiveness that's annoying
[11:47] <Strange> lol
[11:47] <Strange> thats what block is for girl
[11:47] <Strange> you rstressing about about a common thing
[11:47] <frenchie> lol
[11:47] <Strange> sending packets is what the net IS
[11:47] <frenchie> well
[11:47] <frenchie> its a known thing that restech doesn't like me
[11:47] <frenchie> hehe
[11:48] <Strange> well then find out where the mnachine is
[11:48] <Strange> and pull the plug
[11:48] <frenchie> haha
[11:48] <Strange> that be what id do
[11:48] <Strange> id try to find the building
[11:48] <frenchie> and just how do i go about finding where the machine is?
[11:48] <Strange> well you can gain alot of info by scanning them back
[11:49] * frenchie lives 3 floors above restech
[11:49] <Strange> reverse dns it
[11:49] <Strange> oh well
[11:49] <Strange> thats handy
[11:49] <frenchie> lol
[11:49] <Strange> what is some of the machines named ip's
[11:50] <frenchie> ok, i haven't woken up yet.....named ip?
[11:50] <frenchie> wow, this is bad
[11:50] <frenchie> lol
[11:51] <Strange> you know
[11:51] <Strange> /dns ip
[11:52] * frenchie smacks herself
[11:52] <frenchie> heh
[11:52] <Strange> np
[11:53] <frenchie> all i get is 188rts177.wuh.wustl.edu = 128.252.188.177
[11:56] <Strange> ok
[11:56] <Strange> wow
[11:56] <Strange> i guess they are all the same
[11:56] <frenchie> ?
[11:56] <Strange> your is the same
[11:57] <Strange> 249rts138.wuh.wustl.edu
[11:57] <frenchie> yeah
[11:57] <Strange> i was looking for somethign to identify building or department
[11:57] <frenchie> nope
[11:58] <Strange> i doubt its tech
[11:59] <Strange> nothing to be gained by that
[11:59] <Strange> i believe its caused or the ip switch
[11:59] <Strange> umm you could also do that you know get a new net card and change machine name so they cant locate you as easy
[12:00] <frenchie> new net card?
[12:00] <Strange> yes
[12:01] <frenchie> hm, looks like they just stopped
[12:01] <Strange> IP addresses are generated by your mac address
[12:01] <Strange> thats how you get the same one after reboot that dncp server sees your mac... generally
[12:02] <Strange> dont go net mad on me frenchie o0
[12:03] <Strange> lol
[12:03] <frenchie> lol
[12:03] <Strange> thats what i call it
[12:03] <frenchie> wouldn't know where to begin :p
[12:03] <Strange> it begins with wall entries o0
[12:03] <frenchie> rofl
[12:03] <frenchie> now 1 ip is using different ports to hit 1 of my ports
[12:03] * frenchie stops looking
[12:04] <Strange> what port?
[12:04] <frenchie> 1900
[12:04] <Strange> oh no that umm
[12:04] <Strange> a sort of broadcast for dhcp success
[12:04] <frenchie> o
[12:04] <Strange> 1900 is tjhat common
[12:05] <Strange> hit repai ip
[12:05] <Strange> and youll seee your own macine do it
[12:05] <frenchie> repair ip?
[12:05] <Strange> ever want to get them good stuff UDP down on port 1
[12:06] <Strange> thats the thcp multiplexer so its hard to lacate at first
[12:06] <frenchie> wish i knew more about tcp/ip packets etc
[12:07] <Strange> yeah me too
[12:07] <Strange> Im stUPid
[12:07] <frenchie> well
[12:07] * frenchie knows nothing
[12:07] <frenchie> u know lots
[12:07] <frenchie> lol
[12:07] <Strange> me na..... im just making it all up as i go
[12:07] <Strange> actully

[12:09] <Strange> im making the "regional field supervisor" come to my house tomorrow ... that will get someone pissed i bet.
[12:09] <frenchie> haha
[12:11] <Strange> did you know charters system automaticly shuts off that second modem?
[12:12] <frenchie> wtf
[12:12] <Strange> yeah lol
[12:12] <frenchie> thats helpful
[12:12] <Strange> if it sees an account with two it assumes a switch was made and resets them turning off the one modem.
[12:12] <frenchie> geez
[12:12] <Strange> i wasnt to happoy bout that
[12:18] <frenchie> that sux man
[12:18] <Strange> i guess terroristic threats isnt the way to handle it
[12:18] <Strange> but ive made 20 calls in a month
[12:19] <Strange> anyway ..
[12:20] <Strange> i have a customer machine ... he wants this poig yesterday and i can get motivated to do it

[23:44] <Strange> lol wait to change
[23:44] <Strange> till after it finishes recover
[23:44] <Strange> i got to put a stop in there
[23:44] <Strange> keep forgetting
[23:44] <Lethal_INjection-away> i am getting that way, just did 1999, 2000, 2001, and ammended 2002 tax returns.....i been doing taxes for the last 8 hours
[23:45] <Strange> got me a new sterio for the truck and one for the house...
[23:46] <Strange> got me a lawnmower finally too lol
[23:46] <Strange> now the neighbor will talk to me again
[23:46] <Lethal_INjection-away> packing getting ready to move, made all the arrangements today for everything to be on friday the 28th, the manager was nice enough to give me the keys to the new place so i could utilize the help on thanksgivining weekend
[23:46] <Strange> great
[23:47] <Strange> i finalluy got both modems online
[23:47] <Strange> thats about it for news here ....
[23:47] <Strange> othert than that same as it ever was
[23:47] <Lethal_INjection-away> decided to go with dsl, it should be on about 5 days or dec. 5th
[23:47] <Strange> thats to bad
[23:47] <Strange> dsl is way slower
[23:47] <Strange> and your ip changes
[23:48] <Lethal_INjection-away> it was purley a financial decision, i got the dsl for 19.95 a month thru sbc, and cable was $45 a month, but its never too late to change
[23:49] <Strange> hey thats your call man anything is better than dialup
[23:49] <Strange> im just into speed
[23:49] <Strange> and and much of it as they will pipe to me
[23:50] <Lethal_INjection-away> if this tax situation works out the way i got the numbers figured, it will buy a real nice new system, and put a nice cushion to bounce back on

[23:52] <Strange> cheap ios the onyl reason anyone goes with dsl anyway
[23:52] <Strange> they are se3lling cheap and cable is selling fast
[23:53] <Lethal_INjection> who do you use, comcast
[23:54] <Strange> charter
[23:55] <Strange> shit am i tired
[23:55] <Lethal_INjection> i got two options on comcast, i forget the speed diff. but its on there website, but they are the only cable co. currentyly in that area
[23:55] <Lethal_INjection> i had charter in arkansas, they must serve or specialize in like rural areas
[23:56] <Strange> well we got three line speeds here int he residential department and they start at 39 then 49 and then 59 bucks
[23:57] <Strange> i think
[23:57] <Strange> the low speed is like dsl
[23:58] <Strange> man im updating a customer machine and its taking forever to get it dsone
[23:58] <Lethal_INjection> when i get a new system i will have to optimize with cable, but for now this dinasour off dial-up and on dsl will be heaven for awhile
[23:58] <Lethal_INjection> is it the one with the surround sound?
[23:58] <Strange> the house one
[23:59] <Strange> ive still got to get some better speakers .. the neighbor hasnt complained yet
[23:59] <Strange> brb gonna put the script on the customner machine

[16:10] <m0> frenchie
[16:10] <frenchie> m0
[16:11] <m0> Easiest way for you to address that question
[16:11] <m0> Would be to create a custom window that shows all your channels
[16:11] <frenchie> hm, true
[16:11] <frenchie> seems like i remember strange mentioning something before
[16:11] <m0> It's a simple loop, create a scrollable listbox.
[16:12] <frenchie> yeah
[16:12] <m0> That's the way I do mine...:)
[16:12] <frenchie> lol...care to share or ya gonna make me write my own?
[16:12] <m0> Well, do you want a dialog listbox or a custom box?
[16:13] <frenchie> hm, don't know that it matters
[16:14] <m0> I can write a quick script to do the custom box...I'd have to play with a dialog box for a bit to get it the right size.
[16:14] <m0> It's been over a year since I wrote anything, so I'm a little rusty.
[16:15] <frenchie> o...if you don't have something already done don't worry about it
[16:15] <m0> It's no trouble...Only takes 5 minutes.

[16:19] <Strange-out> if they got alot of them
[16:19] <Strange-out> and umm
[16:20] <Strange-out> thats why 1. i use break and 2. dont answer questions addressed to other people
[16:21] <Strange-out> frenchie its a mirc setting to make the channel bar more rows
[16:22] <Strange-out> under display

[12:30] <frenchie> i've done it um twice
[12:31] <Strange> oh big difference for the drive itself
[12:32] <frenchie> well it should be noticeable so i feel like it was worth it
[12:32] <frenchie> lol
[12:35] <Strange> well if you benched file seeks youd see the difference
[12:36] <Strange> your drive can fail for failing to defrag
[12:36] <Strange> not likely but it can
[12:36] <frenchie> interesting
[12:36] <Strange> when your files are fragmented the head has to work harder to get the files
[12:37] <Strange> it gets a piece then moves then gets a piece
[12:37] <Strange> and that can happen a hundred times on one file
[12:38] <Strange> it will in fact speed your machine up
[12:38] <Strange> lastnight this one just shut down with a bad bios checksum ...

[23:40] <Strange> yeah finally a floppy drive that will format a disk
[23:40] <Strange> my HD took to resetting agian though o0
[23:40] <Strange> go figure that one
[23:40] <frenchie> oO
[23:41] * frenchie fixed her computer problem on her own
[23:41] <frenchie> :)
[23:41] <Strange> nice
[23:41] <Strange> what was it?
[23:42] <frenchie> my keyboard driver was corrupt
[23:42] <frenchie> i think
[23:42] <frenchie> so i could use my mouse in windows
[23:42] <Strange> ah man thats whats been happening here
[23:42] <frenchie> but once i hit a key
[23:42] <frenchie> both keyboard and mouse died
[23:42] <frenchie> i could remote in
[23:42] <frenchie> and use it just fine
[23:42] <frenchie> borrowed someone else's keyboard
[23:42] <Strange> ahh driver for sure or the ps/2 port is going one or the other
[23:42] <frenchie> didn't work
[23:43] <frenchie> checked the device manager
[23:43] <frenchie> and the keyboard had an error
[23:43] <frenchie> so i updated the driver
[23:43] <frenchie> and it warned me that my mouse was on the same port and i might screw up the mouse
[23:43] <frenchie> went ahead
[23:43] <frenchie> keyboard worked
[23:43] <frenchie> mouse woudln't move
[23:43] <frenchie> so i used the keyboard to get in and update the mouse driver
[23:43] <frenchie> and now they both work
[23:44] <Strange> cvool
[23:44] <Strange> nice work
[23:44] <Strange> i deleted all my VM's
[23:44] <Strange> trying to stop the drive from resetting and now it does it in windows when i boot lol
[23:44] <frenchie> heh
