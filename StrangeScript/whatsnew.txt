* What is New in version 6.1?
  Released August 29th, 2003.

A fresh new version of mIRC! With this new release we hope to address most, if not all, of the comments, requests and remarks we received after the release of version 6.03, a year ago. Lots and lots of new features and functions have been implemented.

Lots of things have been fixed. Like the default browser issue, a /background bug, an editor dialog bug that most likely was the cause of odd script problems, a memory bug relating to registry handling, a /whois related memory bug, a problem with background pictures, and a popup menu resources bug.

Lots of other things have improved; All Socks5 firewall error messages are now displayed correctly, double-clicking on web/ftp hotlinks now displays a warning dialog before the site is opened, and an important change was made to the way files are created, opened, read, etc. for window logging, dcc sends/gets, and the list channels dialog. The amount of files opened for logging, sends/gets, etc. is no longer limited to a maximum total of 50 or so open files. DCC commands, such as /dcc send, ignore, etc. are now also handled in the form /dccsend, /dccignore, etc. and should also allow /dccallow etc.

We're now using Visual C++ .NET 7.0 to compile mIRC. This also means nicknames are sorted a bit different, nicks beginning with certain non-alphabetic characters eg. _ ' etc. are being placed above normal nicks. This appears to be the standard sorting method in Windows, which Visual C++ abides by consistently. It now applies to the whole of mIRC.
Support for the .jpeg extension has been added, custom file-handling commands and identifiers which allow you to open multiple files for reading and writing. A file type ignore warning explains why a file transfer is ignored, with a direct link to the options dialog, dcc ignore section. Also a new section was added to the servers.ini file from which mIRC will select an initial network to connect to. mIRC no longer defaults to DALnet. 

Lots of interface changes this time; Check out the visual styles and new buttons, dialogs, menus etc. A single toolbar button replaces the previously separated aliases, remotes and popups button. The red light is now on when any of ctcp/event/raw are enabled, and off when they are all disabled. A right-click on the toolbar button displays a most recently used files list. At first this looks a bit odd, but it will just take some getting used to. With the color scheme option you can switch between different color schemes easily. 

And scripters, there is lots of fun for you; with the $ event prefix the matchtext section of a remote event definition can now contain a regular expression! Binary variables no longer have an upper limit on the number of bytes that can be stored. And $compress() and $decompress() functions have been added that compress/decompress files and binary variables. The result is raw compressed data. Khaled managed to load a multi-megabyte file into a binary variable and compress, encode and write it to a new file, and then reverse the process. Fun stuff eh!

- The "enable" sounds option in the sounds dialog now affects most sounds, including highlight, notify, window/icon flashing, etc. Sound requests and Agents still need to be enabled/disabled individually. This does not affect the use of sound-related commands in scripts.

- Pressing Control-C while marking text in a window now copies the text and cancels the mark process. It took eight years to think of that. It's all about quality you know ;)

- Remember how you can 'collapse' all windows you have opened on a network into their status window with Alt+F1? The status window switchbar button now displays the highlight state of all associated windows hidden with Alt+F1.

- Disconnecting via the file menu/toolbar/disconnect command now results in a soft disconnect, allowing any pending server info to be displayed. Incoming data will not trigger scripts, etc. during this time. Eg. if you connect to EFnet, and then disconnect, EFnet sends a "Closing Link" message to the client. Past versions of mIRC wouldn't display that since they were performing a hard disconnect.

Ok, I have to stop. There is too much to tell in this limited space. You'll have to dig through the help file and the list 
below to get hold of the complete list of changes and their impact. If you have questions, may we invite you to the message boards on mIRC's website? These discussion forums offer great help with everything related to mIRC and its features.

I'm sure you will have a lot of fun with this new mIRC!

       and $feof below.

   /fclose <name | wildcard>
       Closes specified files.

   /flist [name | wildcard]

       Returns next cr/lf delimited line.

   $fread(name | N, M, &binvar)
       Returns number of bytes read into binary variable, where

122.The $() identifier used in the matchtext section of a remote
    event definition can now use $1- to reference the incoming line.
123.The matchtext section of a remote event definition can now
    contain a regular expression. You must specify the $ event prefix
    to use this feature.

    on $*:TEXT:m/regular expression/switches:#:/echo message: $1-

    The 'm' and switches are optional. The // are required. If
    switches are used they must be standard PCRE switches, otherwise
    the match will fail. You can use switch 'S' to strip control
    codes from $1-.

124.On systems that support it, mIRC uses the new format for the
    browse for folder dialog, eg. $sdir() etc.
125.Added toolbar disconnect confirm option: requires two clicks
    to disconnect from a server, to prevent accidental disconnects.
126.Fixed $mp3() not returning correct .length for large mp3s.
127.The on CONNECTFAIL event now sets $1- to the error message.
128.Fixed $isdde() bug.
129.Added /color -s "scheme name" to allow changing of color schemes,

130.Individual incoming lines (numeric 322 during a channel listing)
    can now be /halted in a script.
131.Fixed popup menu resources bug. Submenus which were merged due to
    duplicate names were not being freed afterwards.
132.Control+Enter with a /! prefixed command now triggers on INPUT.
133.Changing the flash settings in IRC options now applies them to

139.Extended $fline(), where the T parameter can be 1 to use a
    listbox, 2 to use regex, or 3 for both.
140.Closing a debug @window now turns off debugging for that server.
141.Added "paste confirm" option to confirm dialog, displays warning
    you when you try to paste more than N lines of text to a window.
142.Added Key combination Alt+X to toggle maximized state of a
    window.
143.Binary variables no longer have an upper limit on the number of
    bytes that can be stored.
144.Added $compress(file|&bvar, blN) and $decompress(file|&bvar, blN)
    that compress/decompress files/binary variables. The result is
    raw compressed data. Where -b indicates a binary variable in the
    first parameter, and -lN sets a compression level of 1 to 6 (the
    default is 6).
145.Added /write -n switch, prevents /write from appending the line
    with a $crlf.
146.Using /hdec on a non-existent hash table item now sets it to a
    default value of -1.
147.Added /debug -i <...> [identifier] which calls the specified
    identifier before a debug line is logged. The return value of
    the identifier is used as the debug line.
148.The "enable" sounds option in the sounds dialog now affects most
    sounds, including highlight, notify, window/icon flashing, etc.
    Sound requests and Agents still need to be enabled/disabled
    individually. This does not affect the use of sound-related
    commands in scripts.
149.Pressing Control-C while marking text in a window now copies the
    text and cancels the mark process.
150.Added /server -pfoc switches, which prevent: perform, popup
    favorites folder, autojoin channels, and on connect event, on
    connecting to a server.
151.Time and date identifiers eg. $ctime() now return $null if an
    invalid time/date is specified.
152.Status window switchbar button now displays highlight state of
    associated windows hidden with Alt+F1.
153.Disconnecting via the file menu/toolbar/disconnect command now
    results in a soft disconnect, allowing any pending server info
    to be displayed. Incoming data will not trigger scripts, etc.
    during this time.
154.Added "show nicks on join" option to IRC options dialog.
155.Added "Alt+Z closes active window" option to keys dialog.
156.The $ticks identifier should now take account of the 49.7 day
    windows tick counter wrapping around to zero.

    lookup.
163.Fixed $rand() number distribution bug.
164.Fixed mark/copy display bug.
165.Fixed /did not showing/hiding tabs and their contents properly.
166.Added $comcall(name, alias,...) and $dllcall(filename, alias,...)
    identifiers, same format as $com() and $dll(), except these
    return immediately and allow the script to continue running. When
    the COM/DLL returns, the specified alias is called.
