Welcome to mIRC, an Internet Relay Chat client.

mIRC attempts to provide a user-friendly interface for use with
the Internet Relay Chat network. The IRC network is a virtual
meeting place where people from all over the world can meet and
talk.

To IRC all you need to do is Connect to a server, Join a channel,
and Chat!

mIRC will guide you through these initial stages and hopefully
you'll be chatting in no time. If you get stuck or want to find
out more about a certain feature, just click on a Help button
in a window or browse the Help file and you should find many
hints to help you out.

As you become more experienced you can also start configuring
mIRC's features to suit your own needs and tastes, features such
as colours, fonts, function keys, aliases, popup menus, scripts,
sounds, and many others.

Remember to visit the mIRC website at http://www.mirc.com for
the latest version and information.

Good luck, and have fun.
