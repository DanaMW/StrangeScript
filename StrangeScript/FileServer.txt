Fileserver commands
The commands availabe to a user connected to your fileserver are:
cd <directory> - change to the specified directory. 
dir [-b|k] [-#] [/w] - lists the name and size of each file in the current directory. The /w switch
forces a 	wide listing. The [-b|k] selects bytes or k's. The [-#] specifies the number of files on
each line in a horizontal listing.
ls [-b|k] [-#] - lists the name of each file in the currenty directory using a wide listing.
get <filename> - asks the fileserver to DCC Send the specified file.
read [-numlines] <filename.txt> - reads the specified text file.
The user will be sent a default of 20 lines and then prompted whether to continue listing.
The -numlines option changes the default number of lines to a value between 5 and 50.
help - lists the available commands.
exit or bye - terminates the connection.
Note:
If a user is idle for too long the fileserver will automatically close the connection.
A user is limited to opening a single fileserver session at any one time.
