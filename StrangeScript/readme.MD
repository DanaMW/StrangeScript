# StrangeScript Current

## Working on modernizing the old code in the new script before I drop more old stuff in. I am almost done.

You should be able to drop AdiIrc into the directory and go. With a little adjustment, you should be good. This is what im working on today to trim out code from the old StrangeScript. This is the current root folder. Here and everything below it. You can grab it and install the portable AdiIRC OR install these files over the default files in the installed ones for AdiIRC.

## Finally, I got a simple bot working so I could test things. I am here now and beginning to drop in all the working stuff.
