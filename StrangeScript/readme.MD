## StrangeScript Current

Working on modernizing the old code in the new script before I drop more old stuff in. Almost done.

You should be able to drop AdiIrc into the directory and go. With a little adjustment, you should be good. This is what im working on today to trim out code from the old StrangeScript.

Finally, I got a simple bot working so I could test things. I am here now and beginning to drop in all the working stuff.
