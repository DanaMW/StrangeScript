The original mIRC script. StrangeScript Â©1999-2024
Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this
little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it
and add it to your script at least give me credit, in
your script, or click me a like above, which is the
right thing to do. Thank you.

If you want to talk I am on DalNet.

In StrangeScript I started with the COMPLETE and ORIGINAL
StrangeScript just the way it was the day I parked it.
Now I have decided to work on it and fix all the things
I haven't done it in 10 years. Here we go. This script is
mIRC only. I stashed the AdiIRC copy up there.
```

```
To UPDATE grab the SYSTEM folder in StrangeScript.
Then just do /RELOAD, and answer NO. Do this with the
script running. It won't hurt a thing.
```

```
To use the new bot, do /bot OFF first then /bot on. That
resets the bot. You may use /bot off at any time the bot
needs resetting. The bot is multi-server, you can have 1 
copy running on each server if you like.
