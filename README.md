# Welcome To StrangeScript Information

```
The original mIRC script. StrangeScript Â©1999-2024
Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this
little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it and
add it to your script at least give me credit, in your
script, which is the right thing to do. Thank you.
If you would like my help I am on DalNet
```

```
In StrangeScript you have the script uploaded the
COMPLETE and ORIGINAL StrangeScript just the way it was the
day I parked it. Now I have decided to work on it and fix
all the things I haven't done in 10 years. Here we go.
This script is mIRC only.
I stashed the AdiIRC copy up there.
```

```
To update just grab the SYSTEM folder in StrangeScript.
