The original AdiIRC/mIRC script. StrangeScript ©1999-2023
Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this
little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it and
add it to your script at least give me credit, in your
script, which is the right thing to do. Thank you.
If you would like my help running my script you should
have the new script running. Just copy it to local folders
like it is and drop AdiIRC in there and run and configure it.
Then I can help you. Other than that good luck ripper. I can
try, but I am not going to like it.

COMPLETE and ORIGINAL StrangeScript just the way it was the
day I parked it. Done in the hopes the code will be useful
to someone. It really does have everything in it, Have fun.
The original was a mIRC script. (Browse me)

StrangeScript Current is a trimmed down everything working
version of the original script converted to run on AdiIrc.
I am slowly adding things into it from the old one to make
it more complete.(Use me)
