The original mIRC script. StrangeScript Â©1999-2025
Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this
little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it
and add it to your script at least give me credit, in
your script, or click me a like above, which is the
right thing to do. Thank you.
```

Notice: This is NOT a beginner script.This script requires
skill with IRC servers and mIRC to use. I warned you.
```

```text
In StrangeScript I started with the COMPLETE and ORIGINAL
StrangeScript just the way it was the day I parked it.
Now I have decided to work on it and fix all the things
I haven't done it in 20+ years. Here we go. This script is
mIRC only. I stashed the AdiIRC copy up there.
```

```text
To UPDATE grab the SYSTEM folder in StrangeScript.
Then just do /RELOAD, and answer NO. Do this with the
script running. It won't hurt a thing.
```

```text
There is a small bot, do /bot OFF first then /bot ON.
That resets the bot. You may use /bot OFF at any time the
bot needs resetting. The bot is multi-server, you can have
1 copy running on each server if you like.
I am fond of the main bot, MBot (MasterBot) Runs off its own copy of mIRC in the MBot folder. That is it's own session.
It is fully integrated into the script. but I like to copy
everything over to another machine and run it. You don't
have to, but you can.
```

```text
I hope this old script helps you build up your own
script. There is some very good code in here that still
works perfectly well. You can learn a lot from it.
I hope you have fun.
```

```text
I am updating the original bot, MasterBot (MBot).
It seems to be running fine but if you use it
and see something let me know.
