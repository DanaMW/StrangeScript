The original (AdiIRC or mIRC) script - StrangeScript Â©1999-2023 Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it which is perfectly okay with me at least drop me a star to let me know you were here, would you?

You will find me on:
DalNet ( irc.dal.net ) in #StrangeScript,#Transend
IRCgo ( irc.ircgo.org ) in #StrangeScript,#Transend
Libera.Chat ( irc.Libera.Chat ) in #StrangeScript,#Transend

What we have here is:

StrangeScript (current)
StrangeScript Current is a trimmed down everything working
version of the original script converted to run on AdiIrc.
I am slowly adding things into it from the old one to make
it more complete.

StrangeScript (original)
In strangeScript Original you have the script uploaded the
COMPLETE and ORIGINAL StrangeScript just the way it was the
day I parked it. Done in the hopes the code will be useful
to someone. It really does have everything in it, Have fun.
The original was a mIRC script.

Transend AdiIrc (new)
Transend AdiIrc - Has it's own repo now.
