The original AdiIRC/mIRC script. StrangeScript Â©1999-2023 Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it and add it to your script at least give me credit, in your script, which is the right thing to do. Thank you.

In strangeScript Original you have the script uploaded the
COMPLETE and ORIGINAL StrangeScript just the way it was the
day I parked it. Done in the hopes the code will be useful
to someone. It really does have everything in it, Have fun.

StrangeScript SS
StrangeScript Current is a trimmed down everything working
version of the original script converted to run on AdiIrc.
I am slowly adding things into it from the old one to make
it more complete.
