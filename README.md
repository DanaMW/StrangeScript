The original AdiIRC or mIRC script - StrangeScript Â©1999-2023 Dana L. Meli-Wischman

You will find me on:
DalNet ( irc.dal.net ) in #StrangeScript,#Transend
IRCgo ( irc.ircgo.org ) in #StrangeScript,#Transend
Libera.Chat ( irc.Libera.Chat ) in #StrangeScript,#Transend

In strangeScript Original you have the script uploaded the COMPLETE and ORIGINAL StrangeScript in the hopes the code will be useful to someone. It really does  have everything in it, Have fun. The original was a mIRC script.

SrangeScript Current is a trimmed down everything working version of the original script converted to run on AdiIrc. I am slowly adding things into it from the old one to make it more complete.

Transend AdiIrc - coming very soon.
