The original mIRC script. StrangeScript Â©1999-2024
Dana L. Meli-Wischman. I put a bunch of time into this
little thing. If you are going to rip out a piece of it
and add it to your script at least give me credit, in
your script, or click me a like above, which is the
right thing to do. Thank you.
```

```text
Notice: This is NOT a beginner script.This script requires
skill with IRC servers and mIRC to use. I warned you.
```

```text
In StrangeScript I started with the COMPLETE and ORIGINAL
StrangeScript just the way it was the day I parked it.
Now I have decided to work on it and fix all the things
I haven't done it in 20+ years. Here we go. This script is
mIRC only. I stashed the AdiIRC copy up there.
```

```text
To UPDATE grab the SYSTEM folder in StrangeScript.
Then just do /RELOAD, and answer NO. Do this with the
script running. It won't hurt a thing.
```

```text
To use the new bot, do /bot OFF first then /bot on. That
resets the bot. You may use /bot off at any time the bot
needs resetting. The bot is multi-server, you can have 1
copy running on each server if you like.
The OLD bot MBot (MasterBot) Runs off its own copy of mIRC.
It is fully integrated into the script.
```

```text
I hope this old script helps you build up your own
script. There is some very good code in here that still
works perfectly well. You can learn a lot from it.
I hope you have fun.
```

```text
I updated the original bot, MasterBot (MBot).
It seems to be running fine but if you use it
and see something let me know.
