16/08/2007 - mIRC v6.3

Changes:
1.Fixed /var bug when parsing multiple $identifiers() on one line.
2.Fixed /auser bug halting script if user already existed.
3.Fixed /toolbar -fl bug when an item in toolbar.ini contained a
  popup @menu.
4.Fixed custom DLL delay-unload feature so that it is only applied
  when mIRC exits. In other cases, the DLL is unloaded immediately.
5.Fixed mIRC always forcing an SSL +port if the last connection was
  an SSL +port.
6.Fixed popup menu positioning bug when pressing spacebar to display
  popup close to edge of Windows desktop.
7.Fixed $inroundrect() and $inellipse() bug.
8.When connecting to a round robin dns pool ip address the original
  connect address is now remembered and the connect message now has
  "dns pool" appended to it.
9.Fixed round robin dns pool ip address bug with SSL connections not
  remembering original host address during verification.
10.Fixed /queryrn bug not renaming same name with different case.
11.Fixed right-click popup menu selections not working correctly
   under Vista in some cases.
12.Fixed Servers List popup menu not displaying items correctly.
13.Fixed firewall password corruption bug.
14.Fixed script editor minimize/restore bug.
15.Fixed $sin/$cos/etc. rounding errors.
16.Fixed ? marked urls being deleted incorrectly while mIRC was
   running.
17.Fixed color codes not being processed properly in wrapped lines
   in some situations.
18.Fixed URL links not being opened with default browser under Vista.
19.The -r command line switch behaviour has been changed so that if
   no path is specified after -r, mIRC will use the executable path.
20.For Vista compatibility, new installations of mIRC now save all
   settings in the User's "Application Data\mIRC" folder by default.

   However, if the installer or mIRC find mirc.ini in the same folder
   as mirc.exe they will use the mirc.exe folder for all settings.
   Users installing over an old version of mIRC should therefore see
   no change in behaviour.

   The installer is now also aware of administrator and standard user
   accounts and installs mIRC accordingly.

21.Fixed command prefix /!. parsing inconsistencies across routines.
22.Fixed "// echo hello" being parsed as "//echo hello". The parser
   now halts parsing of empty // commands.
23.Fixed reload logs bug, was loading logs in wrong order.
24.Fixed on KICK event clearing $chan/$nick too early when you are
   kicked from a channel.
25.Fixed /drawtext color parsing bug in picture @windows.
26.Fixed /toolbar -fs bug, icon size was being saved incorrectly.
27.Fixed servers dialog intermittent gpf bug when sorting servers.
28.Fixed /dcc send -l and -m parsing bugs.
29.Fixed irc:// links not working under Vista.
30.Changed registry handling to ensure that mIRC works the same way
   whether run under administrator or standard user accounts.

   mIRC no longer updates the Uninstall section of the registry to
   point to the currently running mIRC, the Uninstall section is
   now only set by the installer. Removed -nouninst command line
   switch since this is no longer applicable.

   Also irc:// links are now only added to the Current User registry,
   not the local machine registry and this is only done when mIRC
   is run, not by the installer.

   The -service command line switch has been removed from the help
   file though it is still supported under 95/98/ME.

31.mIRC no longer uses an internal uninstaller, instead the install
   program now places an uninstall.exe in the mIRC folder.
32.Fixed dialog table definition not being able to call local aliases
   if dialog was opened from the command line.
33.Extended custom dialog "tab id" parameter to allow id to be an
   alias/identifier.
34.Fixed comments not being parsed correctly in the users list.
35.Fixed mouse cursor display bug during mark/copy.
36.Added internal U3 support to mIRC. mIRC looks for these command
   line parameters -appStart, -appStop, and -hostCleanUp, and looks
   for U3_HOST_EXEC_PATH and U3_APP_DATA_PATH environment variables.
37.Fixed ini storage bug when using -portable switch.
38.Changed -portable command line switch behaviour. Now makes mIRC
   both 1) avoid use of the registry and 2) use the executable folder
   as the mirc.ini folder.
39.Fixed /if parser not reporting invalid operator for => and =<,
   and added not support for !> !<= etc.

   unable to write to the file.
42.Added support for positioning Treebar at top/bottom of mIRC window.
43.Added support for network specific notify nicks. If no network
   is specified, nick is used on all networks. Extended command to
   /notify -n <nick> [network] [note], where -n indicates network
   has been specified. Also added $notify().network.
44.Changed "Received Files" explorer display to show folders pane.
45.Notify/URLs list windows are now displayed in both the treebar
   and the switchbar.
46.Changed the way the notify list window is displayed on connect.
47.Added -noreg command line switch to make mIRC avoid use of the
   registry (to make up for old -portable behaviour).
48.Fixed $input dialog (and other windows) not being centered on
   desktop correctly if main mIRC window was minimized.
49.Added support for numeric 005 TARGMAX and MAXTARGETS tokens
   when sending privmsgs and notices in /amsg, /ame, /qme, /qmsg,
   /omsg, and /onotice.
50.Fixed notify list routine that was not correctly optimized, may
   have led to high cpu usage/interface lag for some users.

   with keyboard shortcuts, eg. Alt+O, Alt+B, etc.
52.Added support for notify list display in treebar, option enabled

   right-clicked treebar items. System menus are the default. Toggle
   by holding shift key while right-clicking.
54.Added $menutype and $menucontext to supplement $menu. They are
   available during popup menu creation and indicate the menu type
   and context of the menu being created.
55.Changed left-click method on treebar items, it takes one click to
   open and close windows now.
56.Fixed issues with /mkdir and $isdir(). $isdir() will now only
   accept folder names, whereas previously it was accepting filenames
   as well.
57.Changed status window icon so that you can now tell when it is
   connected, connecting, logging on, or disconnecting.
58.Alt+LeftClick no longer changes the status window icon, instead
   it now adds a down arrow to the button. When clicked it displays
   a popup menu of hidden windows.
59.The status window title in switchbar/treebar now always shows the
   network/server name, even when not connected.
60.Added Buffer menu to custom @window system menu.
61.Changed the way files are renamed/copied/deleted to resolve file
   issues experienced by some users.
62.Fixed favorites menu recent channels history bug.
63.Changed the way $active works, was not consistent before.

67.Fixed $wrap() bug not handling bold control codes across multiple

   the list instead of updating an existing nick.

71.Improved error handling in /load command.

76.The /setlayer command can now set the transparency of the main
   mIRC window.
77.When in the Script Editor mIRC no longer considers itself the
   active application, this allows flash/beep/etc. events to trigger.
78.All buttons that select/display files/folders now display the whole
   file/path with ellipsis if necessary.
79.Fixed nick color list freeze issue, instead of updating all nicks
   immediately when colors change, now only updates them when they
   are visible.
80.Moved highlight dialog to address book and added regex support.
81.Fixed options dialog memory leak.
82.Fixed "Move status window..." bug in Group dialog.
83.Fixed wildcard matching bug.
84.Added support for tips, text balloons that pop up near the Windows
   tray to notify you of various events such as incoming messages or
   users in your notify list coming on or leaving IRC.

   Tips only appear when mIRC is not the active application and are
   hidden the moment mIRC becomes active.

   Tips can be configured in the Options/Windows/Options dialog.

   The Highlight dialog in the Address Book also supports tips for
   matched items.

   Tips can also be scripted using the $tip() identifier:

   $tip(name,title,text,delay,iconfn,iconpos,alias,wid)
   Returns Nth position of tip if successful, zero if not.

   name - name of the tip
   title - title
   text - text
   delay - from 3 to 60 seconds
   iconfn - icon filename
   iconpos - icon position in filename
   alias - alias to perform when tip is double-clicked
   wid - id of window to which tip belongs

   name, title, text are required.
   delay, iconfn, iconpos, alias, and wid can be $null.

   $tip(name/N) can be used to list existing tips.

   Notes:

   Right-click in a tip pauses the time-out for all tips.

   Shift+Left-click in a tip closes that tip.

   Double-click in a tip triggers the alias if one is defined,
   or opens the associated window if not.

   The tip automatically fits the text into it and will at most
   widen to quarter of your screen width.

   New tips are queued until older tips time-out. Tips time-out
   at a slower rate if they are not at the head of the queue.

   If no wid is specified, the tip belongs to the status window
   of the currently active connection.

   A tip is closed if the window it belongs to is made active
   or is closed, or if mIRC is made active and the tip belongs
   to an MDI window.

85.Fixed /showmirc -nt bug minimizing mIRC but not activating
   the next application window.
86.Fixed $mp3() not handling unicode tags correctly.

90.By popular request, changed logging method back to old method, no

   and a "scripts" folder is created by default.
92.Added $ebeeps identifier, returns sounds enabled/disabled state.

94.Fixed menubar spaces bug, all scripts are now aligned on load
   using same align routine as editor.
95.Removed support for mirc.hlp file on F1 key, only mirc.chm is
   used now.
96.Fixed editor "monitor file changes" bug with .ini files.
97.When run under Vista mIRC now checks for a corresponding virtual
   store folder at startup. Vista creates virtual store folders for
   older non-Vista compatible applications, such as older versions
   of mIRC. If mIRC finds such a folder, it displays a dialog box
   allowing you to retrieve your old mIRC files and settings.
98.Added $sha1(text|&binvar|filename,[N]) identifier, where N = 0
   for plain text (default), 1 for &binvar, 2 for filename.
99.Updated to PNG 1.2.18 and PCRE v7.2 libraries and to OpenSSL
   0.9.8e support files.
100.The about dialog now displays a second page that loads from the
    mIRC website at http://www.mirc.com/regabout.html. No information
    is sent to the server.

    correctly on exit.
102.Changed compiler optimization settings resulting in slightly
    larger executable.
103.Added Mode menu item to the View menu in the menubar that allows
    you to switch between Normal and Compact modes. Compact mode

    main window, all windows opening on the desktop, and so on.

88.Fixed bug in popup menu parsing when text contained { character.
89.Invisible mode connect option is now enabled by default.
90.Added a Treebar which lists connections and open windows, much like
   the switchbar. It behaves like the switchbar in many ways as well,
   eg. Shift/Control + left-click support, icon blinking, etc. and
   uses various switchbar settings in the Options/Dialog.

   Right-clicking on an item pops up the usual system menu for that
   window. Right-clicking in an empty area of the treebar pops up a
   menu with various display options.

   The treebar width can be set by dragging the border with the mouse,
   and the background and text colors can be set in the colors dialog.

91.The right-click popup menus for the Toolbar/Switchbar now offer
   options that were removed from the Options/Display dialog. The
   Switchbar can now be resized by dragging the border of the bar
   with the mouse.
92.Fixed right-click popup menu bug where menus were being wrongly
   displayed when clicking on window borders.
93.Fixed switchbar display bug when scrolling with mousewheel.
94.Fixed regex bug which was truncating long results instead of
   returning a string too long error.
95.Fixed /server gpf bug with long parameters.
96.Added /window -D switch, allows toggling of desktop/mdi setting
   for custom @windows via system menu.
97.Added $fline().text property.
98.Added /exit -nr switches, -n disables confirmation dialogs, and
   -r restarts mIRC.
99.Extended /window -nN switch, if N = 2, minimizes window without
   auto-expanding its item in the treebar.
100.Fixed / and /! not being treated as text with Control+Enter.
101.Added Up/Down sort buttons for Options/DCC/Folders dialog to set
    order of matching.
102.Added "Minimize mIRC on close" option to Display/Windows dialog.
103.The Reload logs feature in the logging dialog can now be set
    separately for channels and chats.
104.Fixed bug in the Line colors feature in the logging dialog, the
    default line color is now reset correctly if colors are used in
    the line.
105.Fixed minimize option in DCC Send dialog not being applied
    immediately to current dcc send.
106.Added vertical tile option to toolbar and window menu, and to
    auto tile section in Window/Group dialog.
107.Added /abook -wncl switches, open the different tabs in the
    address book dialog.
108.Added "Preserve nicks" feature to Connect/Options dialog. If
    enabled, mIRC will use /tnick internally to ensure that your
    nicknames in the Connect dialog remain static. Also added /mnick
    command to change your main nickname.
109.Added "Include desktop windows" to the Display dialog. If
    disabled, desktop windows are not displayed in the switchbar.
110.Extended /window -wN switch, where 0 = hide from switchbar/treebar,
    1 = show in switchbar, 2 = show in treebar, 3 = show in both.
111.Fixed hotlinks not handling nicknames with multiple prefixes.
112.Default colors are now stored internally in mIRC and are written
    to mirc.ini if no colors are found.
113.Default wav/mid/etc. dcc folder item is now only re-created if no
    extensions section is found in mirc.ini.
114.Extended SendMessage() support. The lParam value can now be used
    to create a uniquely named mapped file. Where lParam = N, the
    mapped filename is mIRCN. If lParam is zero, the filename is mIRC,
    as in previous versions.
115.Added "Auto" option to Switchbar lines setting in Options/Display
    dialog. Auto-expands switchbar as number of buttons changes when
    switchbar is in top/bottom position.
116.Added "Multi-line toolbar" option to Options/Display dialog.
117.Added /toolbar command, allows modification of toolbar buttons.

    /toolbar -aidmsxkNnNzNebwhyNurctplor [N] <name/N> <tooltip>
             <picfile|@> [x y w h] [/alias] [popfile|@]

    -a = add button
    -i = insert button at position [N]
    -d = delete button at position [N] or <name>
    -m = move button <name/N> to position [N]

    -s = separator
    -x = wide button

    -kN = use when adding button to make it a check button
          check/uncheck with N = 1 or N = 0

    -nN = icon index in picfile
    -zN = icon size, 1 = small, 2 = large, 3 = actual

    -eb = enable/disable button [N] or <name>
    -wh = show/hide button [N] or <name>

    -yN = set transparency (0 to 255) for button [N] or <name>

    -u = update display immediately
    -r = reset buttons
    -c = clear all buttons

    To update properties for an existing button:

    -t = tooltip
    -p = picfile
    -l = alias
    -o = popup

    name = unique name assigned to button/separator, it cannot be
           a number

    tooltip = text displayed when the mouse hovers over button

    picfile|@ = picture filename or picture @window
                min 16x16, max 256x256 pixels

    x y w h = position in bitmap and size of bitmap to use
              not for use with icons

    /alias = command performed when button pressed, $!1 = name
    popupfile|@ = popup filename or @menu name

    The tooltip, picfile, alias and popup can be enclosed in quotes
    if necessary. To clear an item use "" empty quotes.

    $toolbar(name/N), if N = 0 returns number of buttons

    Properties: name,type,tip,alias,popup,width,height,wide,
                enabled,visible,checked,alpha

    Note: modifying some of the default mIRC buttons, such as Connect,
    Notify, etc. may not always work since they are managed by mIRC.
    They can however be deleted.

118.Fixed /signal -n bug, was allowing $? dialog in server event.
119.Fixed /!.var conversion to /set -l, was not using the !. prefixes.
120.mIRC now stores a [success] section in servers.ini that lists
    servers that were connected to successfully. When you later
    connect to a server group, the success list is used to prioritize
    server connection attempts. "Clear History" via the servers list
    popup menu clears this list.
121.Fixed various multi-monitor right-click mouse button bugs.
122.Added /help and /winhelp support for .chm files.
123.Added aline/iline/sline/etc. -t switch, forces a re-wrap of all
    lines in a window that have not yet been wrapped to the current
    window size.
124.Toolbar disconnect confirmation feature now displays a question
    mark on the disconnect button when you try to disconnect.
