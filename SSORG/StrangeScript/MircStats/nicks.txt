// MANUAL NICK CONNECTION FILE for mIRCStats
// mIRCStats is (C) Mikko 'Ave' Auvinen

// (NOTE: lines starting with "//" or "##" are comment lines..)


// See mIRCStats help for detailed information how to use nick connection files!


// Problem has been that when someone is ircing from many different locations,
// mIRCStats automatic nick connection never connects there nicks together,
// because these nicks never rename to each other (like: nick is now known as nick_work)

// Another problem is when several persons use the same irc client (and their nicks might
// even start with the same letter), so mIRCStats thinks that these several nicks actually
// belong to just one person.


// NICK CONNECTION FILTERS

// Here you can define which nicks actually do belong to one person - and which don't.
// You can use wildcards which make your life much easier, because many persons use
// several nicks like "Nick", "Nick_work", "Nick_sauna", "NckSurfin", "PartyNick" etc.. 

// In these situations you could just tell mIRCStats that every nick which fits into
// filter "*nick* ; nck*" is actually just one person.


// NICK SEPARATION WITH FILTERS

// If someone named "Nelly" is using Nick's computer occasionally, you can separate him
// by defining another person with filter "nelly", so after this "Nick" and "Nelly" will
// never be connected again.. 

// You can also include '*' in the filter is also Nelly is using nicks like "Nelly_play" etc..

// If you need to separate two persons Who use names like 'Nick' and 'Nickette' with some
// additions after those names (like "NickWork"), you can do it by entering them in the
// right order. mIRCStats searches from top to bottom for matching nick filter, so if you
// put filter "nickette*" to the list first, and after that "nick*" - mIRCStats will
// separate these two persons correctly. Now Nickette's nicks are screened out with the
// first filter, Nicks' nicks match with the second filter. 
// Vice versa it wouldn't work, because it that case both nicks would fit into "nick*" 
// filter. 


// SCREEN NAME

// Another brand new feature is that you can define a "screen name" for any person you like
// with "NAME=<screen name>" - directive. This might come handy when someone is actually
// writing more lines with his "work nick" than with his real nick. In this case mIRCStats
// would use the nick with most lines in stats. Now you can specify that no matter how 
// few lines "Nick" actually wrote, this nick will be shown in the stats instead of 
// "nick_work" or something else..

// Note that screen name only applies in user stats (not in big numbers etc..)

// EXTRA: With valid registration code you can also include HTML-codes to screen names, 
// which means that you can put there almost anything - custom font styles, images etc..



// URL ATTACHED WITH NICK

// Nowadays many irc channels have web pages, where there's maybe a separate page for every
// user on channel. 

// A good idea is to attach an url with a person with mIRCStats directive "URL = <url>".
// After that you stats viewers can just click and browse to any nick's homepage.


// OTHER PROPERTIES

// You can also specify the IMAGE property, normally used to show person's image in
// his/her personal stats section

// SLOGAN property is also shown in personal stats.




// NICK CONNECTION FILE SECTIONS

// Some people generate stats for many large channels. In this case it would be ineffective
// to put all nicks from every channel just to one list, because - needless to say - this
// kind of cross-connection is quite resource-eating process. It's also nicer to divide nicks
// from many channels to logical sections by channel they are on.

// mIRCStats uses [Section]-based nick handling. This way only needed nicks are loaded from 
// file when you run stats for a channel. This makes log processing much faster and saves
// also memory resources.

// After all you might want to define some "nick groups" which apply to any channel you are
// on. You can do this by putting them under [common]-section. It's good idea to put your
// OWN nick under this section, this way you don't need to define it any more under other
// sections.




// LIMITATION: Unregistered version handles only two first nick connection lines,
//             This is just to demonstrate the capabilities of mIRCStats nick connection.

//             Please register your version to get your personal registration code.
//	       Registered version can handle any number of nick connection rules and 
//	       also HTML codes in screen names are allowed!

//	       Run the program for further info. 



// ADDITIONAL INFO

// Wildcards you can use in filters:
// * = any number of characters (example "Mic" and "Micky" would both fit into "mic*")
// ? = exactly one character    (example "Micky" would fit into "Mick?")

// You can have any number of filters per line (=person), but separate them with ';'

// Filters are case-insensitive, so it same whether you write "NiCK*" or "nick*".





// Nick connection info starts from here. Take some time to study the [#example]-section,
// after that just define your own sections for channels you are on like [#mychannel] etc..





// common section: these nick connection rules are loaded for every channel
// Note that example line is commented out with //-characters.


// [common]

// NAME=Ave ;URL = http://www.students.tut.fi/~ave/; ave*        //This line is commented out





// this is section for irc channel #example. These nicks come from examples above.
// Please read more about special directives NAME and URL from above.
